= Jamal Maven Plugin
Jamal maven plugin is a Maven plugin that executes Jamal for several files in the project directory and creates output files processing the Jamal macros.

You can use the plugin even without any Maven project, just executing the command line

----
mvn com.javax0.jamal:jamal-maven-plugin:1.10.2-SNAPSHOT:jamal
----

As an example, you can use the following command line to create the `pom.xml` file(s) from the `pom.xml.jam` files in the root directory and recursively under the modules directories.

----
mvn  -DfilePattern=.*pom\.xml\.jam$ com.javax0.jamal:jamal-maven-plugin:1.10.2-SNAPSHOT:jamal
----

You can download the `null.pom` file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verhas/jamal/master/null.pom` to add it to the actual project and use the `-f null.pom` so that you can run the command even when the `pom.xml` does not exist or even was ruined because you made some mistake editing the `pom.xml.jam`.

----
mvn  -f null.pom -DfilePattern=.*pom\.xml\.jam$ com.javax0.jamal:jamal-maven-plugin:1.10.2-SNAPSHOT:jamal
----

Another possibility is to download the `genpom.xml` file from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verhas/jamal/master/genpom.xml` and use this in the command line:

----
mvn  -f genpom.xml clean
----

This pom file configures the Maven Jamal plugin to process the `pom.xml.jam` files, and this is attached to the
`clean` phase. The `clean` phase was selected because it is much shorter than `generate-sources` or `generate-resources`
and it seems to be a good idea to recompile everything afterward when the pom file has changed.

You can use it starting with version `1.0.2`.

If there is no `pom.xml` for Maven to process, the plugin will search for all files in the current directory or any subdirectory and have the extension `.jam`.
When processing these files, the macro opening string will be `{`, and the macro closing string will be `}`.
(Note that it is only a convention in Jamal, and Jamal itself does not have any default value. These default values, in this case, are set by the plugin.)
Jamal will create the processed files in the same directory where the source file is with the
`.jam` extension chopped off.

If you have an actual Maven project, then you can configure the plugin in the `pom.xml`.

The configuration values are the following:

* `sourceDirectory` defines the source directory. The default is the project source directory.

* `targetDirectory` defines the target directory where the generated files after Jamal processing are written.
The default value is the `target` directory.

* `filePattern` can define a regular expression that matches the file names to be processed. The default value is `\.jam$`, which means that the files with the extension `.jam` are processed only.
If this configuration value is empty, all files are processed, not excluded by the regular expression defined in the `exclude` configuration parameter.

* `exclude` can define a regular expression.
Any file with a name that matches the regular expression will be excluded from the processing.
The default value is an empty string which also means that no file is excluded from the processing.

* `transformFrom` can define a regular expression, which is used to create the output file name from the input file name together with the configuration parameter `transformTo`.
When a source file is processed with the name `sourceDirectory/ ... some path /filename` then the output file will be `(targetDirectory/ ... some path /filename).replaceAll(transformFrom, transformTo)`.
The path and the file name will be all the same as in the input, but instead of the source directory, Jamal will generate the output file in the `targetDirectory` and under the target directory in a subdirectory that matches the subdirectory of the source under the `sourceDirectory`.
The file name and the whole path as a string is transformed using the Java String method `replaceAll()`.
The default value for `transformFrom` is `\.jam$`, and the default value for `transformTo` is an empty string that means that Jamal will remove the `.jam` extension from the end of the file name.

* `transformTo` specifies what to replace the string in the file name that was matched by `transformFrom`.
For further information, see the documentation above about `transformFrom`.

* `macroOpen` can define the macro opening string. The default value is the conventional `{` one character string.

* `macroClose` can define the macro closing string. The default value is the conventional `}` one character string.

Note that when you define a regular expression in the `pom.xml` file, you should not duplicate the `\` escape character.
