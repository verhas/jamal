= Jamal Json integration module






Using this integration module, you can mix Jamal macro text with JSON data.
To use this module, you have to add the dependency to your Maven project, as:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.javax0.jamal</groupId>
    <artifactId>jamal-json</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

Following that, you can use the


. <<define,`json:define`>>
. <<get,`json:get`>>
. <<set,`json:set`>>
. <<length,`json:length`>>
. <<keys,`json:keys`>>


macros.
This macro package was created refactoring the original `jamal-yaml` macro library.
During the development, we created the macros so that they can be used in a similar manner to Yaml macros.
Although we tried to be as close to the structure of the Yaml macros, there are differences.
These differences come from the different nature of Json and Yaml.

== Macros implemented in the package

[[define]]
=== i. `json:define`


You can use this macro to define a JSon structure.
A JSON structure can be a map, a list or a string.
JSon supports other primitive values, but Jamal being a text macro processor handles all other primitive types as strings.

The format of the macro is

[source]
----
{@json:define jsonMacro=JSON content}
----

After the execution of this macro, the name `jsonMacro` will be defined as a user-defined macro and can be used as `pass:[{jsonMacro}]`.
The value will replace the place of the use with the actual unformatted JSON content.

NOTE: Internally, Jamal converts the JSON read in an object structure consisting of strings, primitives, maps, and lists.
The structure is stored in an object of the type `JsonMacroObject`.
This class technically is a user-defined macro.
The `json:define` macro will register the structure among the user-defined macros.
When the name is used the same way as any other user-defined macro (without any argument), the content of the JSON structure is converted to text.

The `jsonMacro` is stored along with the "usual" user-defined macros.
Any usual or other user-defined macro can be redefined any number of times.
If you want to define a JSON macro only if it was not defined prior, use the `?` after the keyword `json:define`.
If you want to get an error message if the macro was already defined, use the `!` after the keyword `json:define`.
This functionality is implemented the same way as it is for the core built-in macro `define`.

The core `define` macro also has options to drive these behaviour.
The `json:define` macro does not.

The example:

[source]
----
{@json:define xyz={
a: this is the string value of a,
b:[ first value of b,second value in b],
c: {a: this is c.a,b: this is c.b}}
}\
{xyz}
----

will result

[source]
----
{"a":"this is the string value of a","b":["first value of b","second value in b"],"c":{"a":"this is c.a","b":"this is c.b"}}
----


The advantage of using this macro over just writing the JSON directly to the output is that:

* You can use user-defined macro parameters mixing the json content with Jamal macros.

* You can modify the structure using the `json:set` macro.

Utilizing user-defined macros, you can use macros inside JSON code, and at the same time, you can use JSON code inside the macros.
That way, you can pull out the part, repeat, and use only the macro as a reference.

[NOTE]
====
When processing JSON input, you can use the `{` and `}` characters as macro opening and macro closing strings.
These characters are paired in the JSON input, therefore they will not interfere with the macro processing.
That is only if we assume that the JSON containing macros do not contain macros themselves, and they are invoked using the `@` in front of their name.
However, when there is a need to evaluate macros before interpreting the JSON, the `{` and `}` characters may cause problems.
You can overcome this setting the macro opening and closing stings to something else, like `{%` and `%}`.
You can also modify the JSON using `{}` in place of every `{` and a `}` in place of every `}`.
This will disturb the balance of the `{` and `}` characters, that may hinder some editor navigation.
You can also use the `{@ident...}` to protect the parts that are pure JSON content without macros.

The recommended way is to use something different from `{`and `}` as macro opening and closing strings.
====


[[get]]
=== ii. `json:get`


This macro will fetch one value or a "sub" json from a JSON structure.
This can be useful when you want to document some configuration or other data structure that is present as a JSON file in your project.
In that case you can import the JSON structure into your Jamal document and refer individual values in it.
The format of the macro is:

[source]
----
{@json:get macro_name/JSONPointer}
----

or

[source]
----
{@json:get macro_name/JSONPointer | macro_name/JSONPointer | ...}
----

The second format will try to get the first, then the second and so on pointer from one or more JSON structures until one of them is found.

The same result can be achieved simply writing the JSONPointer after the name of the JSON macro defined using <<define,`json:define`>>.
In that case you can omit the `@json:get ` starting with the macro name, and you cannot use the second format.

The `JSONPointer` is navigational path documented in the link:https://stleary.github.io/JSON-java/org/json/JSONPointer.html[JavaDoc] api of the JSON library this macro package uses:

> A JSON Pointer is a simple query language defined for JSON documents by RFC 6901.
In a nutshell, JSONPointer allows the user to navigate into a JSON document using strings, and retrieve targeted objects, like a simple form of XPATH.
Path segments are separated by the '/' char, which signifies the root of the document when it appears as the first char of the string.
Array elements are navigated using ordinals, counting from 0.
JSONPointer strings may be extended to any arbitrary number of segments.

If the navigation is successful, the matched item is returned.
A matched item may be a JSONObject, a JSONArray, or a string.
If the JSONPointer string building or the navigation fails a `BadSyntax` exception will happen.

When getting a value out of a JSON user defined macro the macro will automatically be resolved.

==== Examples

[source]
----
{@json:define a={a:"alma",b:2,c: 3,d:[1,2,{q:{h:"deep h"}}]}}\
@json:get a/d/2/q/h = "{@json:get a/d/2/q/h}"
a d/2/q/h = "{a d/2/q/h}"
----

will result

[source]
----
@json:get a/d/2/q/h = "deep h"
a d/2/q/h = "deep h"
----


NOTE: The macro `json:get` is somewhat superfluous, because you can get the same result using the JSON user defined macro with the JSONPointer as parameter.
However, as you can see from the example above, the different approaches provide different readability. Choose wisely.



[[set]]
=== iii. `json:set`


Add some value to an already existing JSON structure.
The format of the macro is:

[source]
----
{@json:set X/path/c=value}
----

Here

* `X` is the name of the JSON structure that is defined in the macro registry.
  In other words, `X` is a macro defined using the macro <<define,`json:define`>>.

* `path` is the path to the value that is added to the JSON structure, names of the keys along the paths `/`
separated.
If the path is empty, then the value is added to the root of the JSON structure.

* `c` is the key of the value that is added to the JSON structure.
If this value is numeric, then the value is added to the array at the given index.
If this value is `*` then the value is added to the array at the end.

The value can be a JSON structure, a string, a number or a boolean.

==== Examples

===== Adding a value to the top level Map

This example adds a new value to the root of the JSON structure.

[source]
----
{@json:define a={a: "this is a simple JSON with a top level Map"}}
{@json:set a/b=
"this is the value to be added to json structure a"}
{a}
----

will result:

[source]
----
{"a":"this is a simple JSON with a top level Map","b":"this is the value to be added to json structure a"}
----


===== Adding element to a Map in the JSON structure

In this example, the value is added to the value of the map from the top level named `b`.

[source]
----
{@json:define a={"a": "this is a simple JSON with a top level Map","b":{}}}
{@json:set a/b/c="this is the value to be added to json structure a"}
{a}
----

will result:

[source]
----
{"a":"this is a simple JSON with a top level Map","b":{"c":"this is the value to be added to json structure a"}}
----


===== Adding elements to an array

This example adds one element to an array.
The added element itself is an array.

[source]
----
{@json:define a=["this is a simple JSON with a top level Map","kukuruc"]}
{@json:set a/*="this is one element"}
{@json:set a/*="this is the second element"}
{a}
----

will result:

[source]
----
["this is a simple JSON with a top level Map","kukuruc","this is one element","this is the second element"]
----




[[length]]
=== iv. `json:length`


This macro can be used to get the length of a JSON array.
The macro first fetches the JSON value using the argument the same way as `json:get` does, but instead of the value it returns the length of the array.
If the value is a boolean, string, number or JSON objects, essentially anything else than an array, then an error will happen.

The result can be used to iterate through the elements, for example using the macros of the module `jamal-prog`.

[source]
----
{@json:length macro_name/JSONPointer}
----

or

[source]
----
{@json:length macro_name/JSONPointer | macro_name/JSONPointer | ...}
----

The second format will try to get the first, then the second and so on pointer from one or more JSON structures until one of them is found.
If one of the pointers finds a value but that is not an array then an error will happen.

==== Examples

[source]
----
{@json:define a={a:"alma",b:2,c: 3,d:[1,2,{q:{h:"deep h"}}]}}\
@json:length a/d/ = "{@json:get a/d}"
----

will result

[source]
----
@json:length a/d/ = "[1,2,{"q":{"h":"deep h"}}]"
----




[[keys]]
=== v. `json:keys`


This macro will fetch one value or a "sub" json from a JSON structure and returns the keys of the structure.
If the result is a boolean, string, number or JSON objects, essentially anything else than an JSON structure, then an error will happen.

The result can be used to iterate through the elements using the core macro `for`.

[source]
----
{@json:keys macro_name/JSONPointer}
----

or

[source]
----
{@json:keys macro_name/JSONPointer | macro_name/JSONPointer | ...}
----

The second format will try to get the first, then the second and so on pointer from one or more JSON structures until one of them is found.
If one of the pointers finds a value but that is not a structure then an error will happen.

The keys are separated by the separator character.
The default separator is a comma.
The separator can be changed by the parameter `separator` or `sep`.

==== Examples

[source]
----
{@json:define a={a:"alma",b:2,c: 3,d:[1,2,{q:{h:"deep h"}}]}}\
@json:keys a/ = "{@json:keys a}"
----

will result

[source]
----
@json:keys a/ = "a,b,c,d"
----
