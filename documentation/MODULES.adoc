= Modules of the Jamal Project
:toc:

This file lists the Jamal modules delivered with each release.
Note that other projects may contain other Jamal modules delivered independently of the modules in this project.


== Module Categories
The different modules fall into one of the four categories:




=== core
__core__ belongs to the core of Jamal, and it is an essential part of the Jamal macro processor

=== embed
__embed__ is a module, which uses Jamal and makes it possible to use Jamal in some specific environment.
Such a module may or may not contain macros.
If it does, the macros are specific to the embedding environment.

=== macro
__macro__ is a package containing macro implementations.
Jamal comes with a limited set of built-in macros.
Specific features are supported by macros implemented in macro libraries.
To use those libraries, they have to be on the module path or on the class path.

=== debugger
__debugger__ is the module implementing the debugger interface of Jamal.
There can be several modules implementing this interface.
Currently, there are two.
One provides a TCP interface for an external debugger.
This implementation is for reference purposes, and it is not feature complete.
The other implementation provides a REST interface towards a debugger client, and it also contains a REACT.js based client.

=== input
__input__ is a module implementing an input handler for Jamal.
Input handlers are loaded via the service loader and can load resource files, maven artifacts, files from JAR archives, etc.



=== packaging

Directory containing different packaging tools to be executed after the release of the Java code version.
These create different packages, like docker image, Debian package, etc.

== Modules
=== 1. link:https://github.com/verhas/jamal/blob/master/jamal-all/README.adoc[ALL] ^_core_^


This module contains no code.
It can be used as a Maven dependency when there is a need to use all Jamal modules.
It can be a convenience supporting some laziness, but in some cases it may be a necessity.

=== 2. link:https://github.com/verhas/jamal/blob/master/jamal-api/README.adoc[API] ^_core_^


`jamal-api` contains interfaces that the Jamal macros and the processing implements.
Some interfaces implement some default methods.
This module contains the `BadSyntax` and `BadSyntaxAt` exception classes, which are thrown when there is some error in the processing.

=== 3. link:https://github.com/verhas/jamal/blob/master/jamal-asciidoc/README.adoc[ASCIIDOC] ^_embed_^


`jamal-asciidoc` is an ASCIIDOCTOR preprocessor preprocessing the text input using Jamal.
The primary use of this module is to install it into WYSIWYG editors that support asciidoctor.
For example, you can use Jamal via this module in IntelliJ.

=== 4. link:https://github.com/verhas/jamal/blob/master/jamal-asciidoc258/README.adoc[ASCIIDOC258] ^_embed_^


This module is a dependency for the `jamal-asciidoc` module.
It provides backward compatibility for the AsciidoctorJ 2.X.X versions.

=== 5. link:https://github.com/verhas/jamal/blob/master/jamal-assertions/README.adoc[ASSERTIONS] ^_macro_^


Contains macros that can be used to perform assertions.
An assertion is usually a constraint checking some string values.
When the assertion fails, the processing will give an error.
You can use assertions to enforce document consistency.

=== 6. link:https://github.com/verhas/jamal/blob/master/jamal-cmd/README.adoc[CMD] ^_embed_^


This module is the command line version of Jamal.
This module has a `public static void main()`, a shell script to start Jamal.
The module also supports jbang to start Jamal.
The module has dependencies for ALL the macro modules so that you can use any macro in your files.
In addition to that, it incorporates the word module to process Microsoft Word documents from the command line.

=== 7. link:https://github.com/verhas/jamal/blob/master/jamal-core/README.adoc[CORE] ^_macro_^


Implements the core built-in macros.

=== 8. link:https://github.com/verhas/jamal/blob/master/jamal-debug/README.adoc[DEBUG] ^_debugger_^


This module implements two debuggers.
The Jamal engine does not contain a debugger itself.
The engine has an SPI that the debuggers can implement and hook into the evaluation process.
This module implements a TCP-based debugger for reference purposes and one with a REST interface.
The TCP implementation is not feature complete and serves reference purposes as a simple implementation of the SPI.
The REST implementation includes a REACT.js based web client, and it is a fully usable debugger.

=== 9. link:https://github.com/verhas/jamal/blob/master/jamal-doclet/README.adoc[DOCLET] ^_embed_^


With this module you can use Jamal macros in your JavaDoc documentation.
