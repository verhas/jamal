{%MACRO name="JShell" since=1.0.0%}

The Java built-in scripting engine JShell can be used to define macros.
The macro {%$ script%} and the macro `JShell` can be used to define JShell scripts.

The macro `JShell` can be used to define methods, classes, variables and so on.
The macro {%$ script%} is to define a script macro that later can be invoked like any other used defined script macro.

When the macro `JShell` or {%$ script%} is used the result is empty string.
When the script is invoked the output of the macro will be what the script prints out to the standard output.

The following example defines a global method, a script using the method and, then it invokes the script.

{%sample/
{@JShell
void hello(){
System.out.println("Hello, " + world);
}
}{@script hello/JShell(world)=hello();}
{hello My Dear}
%}

It simply prints

{%safeoutput%}

The macro `JShell` defines the method `hello()`.
The macro `script` is a script macro that has one argument.
Note that this argument is also the name of the global variable `world`.
This global variable is used in the JShell snippet defined above but this is not an argument to the method.
When we use the line

{%sample/
{hello My Dear}
%}

Jamal will invoke the JShell interpreter executing

{%sample/
String world = "My Dear";
%}

first, and, then

{%sample/
hello();
%}

Since the method `hello()` prints out to the standard output `Hello, My Dear` this is the result of this macro.

If there is some error in the code of the snippet, then Jamal will throw a `BadSyntax` exception.
In this exception the causing exception is included if there is any.
This causing exception should give some clue to find out what the issue is.
If that does not help, then using the interactive JShell program should help.

Creating a JShell execution environment is expensive.
To do that the Java starts a new JVM process for the JShell.
Many Jamal macro processing do not need the extra JShell.
It would slow down Jamal if we created the JShell process for each and every processor even when it is not needed.
The JShell environment is created only when it is unavoidable.
It is when the processing _uses_ the first time a JShell type script.
It not when the script is defined.
It is when the defined script is used.
In the above example the JShell interpreter is created when the `{hello ...}` macro is evaluated.
Only at that point all the prior definitions that were defined in any `{@JShell }` macro are fed into the JShell interpreter.

The consequence is that you do not need to worry about the performance when you design a macro library.
The processed files can bravely import the macros even if they declare JShell usage.
It will not slow down the processing creating a JShell engine, only when the JShell engine is needed.

Another important side effect of this optimization is that you will not get an error message for an erroneous `{@JShell }` macro until the JShell interpreter is used.
When you design a macro library it is not enough to import the library to discover possible errors in the JShell scrips.
The scripts have to be used to manifest the error.
