since version `2.6.0`



This macro will cause an error.
The error message is the input of the macro, with white spaces removed from the start.

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@error This is the error message.}
----

will cause and report an error with the message "This is the error message.".
To test it in a sample we can use the macro `try` with the `!` character after the macro name:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@try! {@error This is the error message.}}
----

will result in:

.output
[source]
----
This is the error message.
----


The use of this macro usually makes sense inside an link:if[`if`] macro, that checks some error condition.
