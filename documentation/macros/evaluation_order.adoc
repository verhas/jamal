= Macro Evaluation Order

The macro evaluation order is a complex algorithm designed to fit all necessary needs.

== Left to Right, Inside to Out

The general rule is that macros are evaluated

. from the start of the file towards the end, and also
. from inside towards outside.

For example, when we write

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{#define a=1}{a}
----

first the macro link:define[`define`] is evaluated and then the user defined macro `a`.
If we have more complex, nested macro uses, like in the example:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{#define b(x)=x x}{b {a}}
----

then the result is

.output
[source]
----
1 1
----


In this case first the macro `a` is evaluated before evaluating `b` (inside first).

== Built-in macro prefix

You use the built-in macros with `#` or `@` in front of the macro's name.
These characters signal that the macro is built-in (as opposed to user defined,) but also they control the evaluation order.

The typical use is to start a macro with the `@` character.
This will instruct Jamal not to evaluate the input of the macro before the macro itself is evaluated.

When we use the `#` character in front of the built-in macro's name then the input is evaluated and after that the macro itself is invoked to process the pre-processed input.

For example:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define a=1}
{@define b={a}}
{#define c={a}}
{@define a=2}
{b}{c}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
21
----


When `b` is defined the macro used inside it is not evaluated.
That is because the character before the macro name `define` is `@`.
Therefore, the value of `b` is literally `pass:[{a}]`.
The macro `a` is already 2 by the time `b` is evaluated.
On the other hand, the definition of `c` uses the `#`.
It means, that the macro use `pass:[{a}]` is evaluated before `c` gets defined.
This way the value of the macro is 1.

== Verbatim Macros

The results of user-defined macros are also evaluated.
This can be controlled and prevented in two ways:

. At the use of it can be inside the `verbatim` constructs.
. During the definition, the macro can be defined as a "verbatim" one.

For example, writing:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@verbatim b}
----

will result in

.output
[source]
----
{a}
----


There is also a shorthand to denote verbatim evaluation of user-defined macros.
If you write a back-tick character in front of the macro name, like in

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{`b}
----

You get the same result:

.output
[source]
----
{b}
----


We can also define `b` to be a verbatim macro:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define [verbatim]b={a}}
{b}
----

and it will also result in

.output
[source]
----
{a}
----


== Other Evaluation Controlling Tools

There are other tools that can be used to modify the evaluation order of the macros.
These include:

- link:ident[`ident`] macro, which s
- link:eval[`eval`] macro that evaluates the input
- Using `!` in front of the macro identifier or in front of the `@` or `#` character.
It is a shorthand for the link:eval[`eval`] macro, and it is described there.
- The link:escape[`escape`] macro can prevent macro evaluation.
- Other built-in macros can also evaluate their input.
