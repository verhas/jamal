{%MACRO name="env" since={%RELEASE:KLOTEN%}%}

`env` returns the value of an environment variable.
The macro can also be used to test that an environment variable exists or not.
If the argument to the macro is the name of an environment variable, then the result will be the value of the variable.
If the variable is not defined, then the macro will result empty string.

{%sample/
{@env JAVA_HOME}

is

{%output%}

on the machine where the original `env.adoc.jam` file was converted to ASCIIDOC.

If there is a `?` after the name of the variable name, then the macro will result either the `true` or `false`.
This can be used to test that an environment variable exists or not.
Testing the value of the environment variable in an `{@if ... }` macro may be misleading when the value is literal `false` or an empty string.

Starting with Jamal {%RELEASE:OBERGLATT%}, it is possible to use `!` after the name of the variable.
In this case, the macro will throw exception when the environment variable is not defined.

The macro does not only check the environment variables when looking for a configuration value.
It looks at

* the Java system properties first,

* then at the environment variables, and finally

* tries to look up the configuration value from the `~/.jamal/setting.properties` or `~/.jamal/setting.xml` file.

When looking up a Java system property the algorithm

* converts the name of the property to lowercase, and

* replaces all `_` characters with dot `.` characters.

When looking up a property from the `~/.jamal/setting.properties` or `~/.jamal/setting.xml` file the algorithm also removes any `JAMAL_` or `jamal.` prefix from the property name.

[NOTE]
====
This search algorithm tries to follow the naming of the Java system properties, environment and properties.
Also, it makes it possible to define something globally for the user, or only for the running shell or only for the running JVM.
The more local configuration overrules the broader one using this algorithm.
