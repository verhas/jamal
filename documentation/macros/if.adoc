= `if`

since version `1.0.0`





The `if` macro makes it possible to evaluate the content conditionally.
The syntax of the macro is:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{#if [options]/test/then content/else content}
----

Here we use `/` as a separator character but this is not hardwired.
The `if` macro uses the link:../ARGSPLIT.adoc[Standard Built-In Macro Argument Splitting] to parse the body of the macro.

The result of the evaluated macro will be the `then content` when the `test` is true, and the `else content` otherwise.

When no options are specified the `test` is true, if

* it is the literal string `true` (case-insensitive),

* it is a signed or unsigned integer number, and the value is not zero,

* it is any other string that contains at least one non-space character, except

* when the `test` is the literal string `false` (case-insensitive).

The literal `false` is false using any combination of upper and lower case letters with or without surrounding spaces.

The evaluation of the test string can be modified using options.
There are  11 options.


The first three options are "boolean" options.
It is enough to use their keyword between the `[` and `]`.
(See examples later.)

* `blank` will test true if the test string is blank, it is empty or contains spaces only.
* `empty` will test true if the test string is zero lengths and does not contain even spaces.
* `not`  will negate the test result.
* `or` can be used with the comparing options when more than one test is needed.
When you specify more than one `equals`, `lessThan`, or `greaterThan` option the test is true if any of the tests is true.
This is the default behavior, so this option is not needed.
Setting `or=false` has no effect and is not the same as using the option `and`.
This option is included only to add readability if needed.
* `and` can be used with the comparing options when more than one test is needed.
When you specify more than one `equals`, `lessThan`, or `greaterThan` option test is true if all the tests are true.
This option cannot be used together with the option `or` and it also needs multiple comparison options.

Note that the options `and` and `or` are simple boolean options.
They can appear only once in the list of the macro options.
You cannot write `{@if [equals=3 or equals=4 or equals=6] /9/a/b}`.
It is recommended to use the `or` or the `and` option following the first comparing option.
For example, `{@if [lessThan=7 and greaterThan=2] /6/it is in (2,7)/out of range}` .
If you feel it is more readable, you can put these options at any place in the list.

The following options will do numerical comparison when the test string is a number.
When any of them are used, then the test string is converted to a number.
If the test string is not a number, the comparison will be done alphabetically.

* `lessThan` (aliases `less`,`smaller`, `smallerThan`) is true if the condition is less than the test value.
* `greaterThan` (aliases `greater`, `bigger`, `biggerThan`, `larger`, `largerThan`) is true if the condition is greater than the test value.
* `equals` (aliases `equal`, `equalsTo`, `equalTo`) is true if the condition is equal to the value.

There is no separate "less than or equal" and "greater or equal" option.
If, for example, you want to test that a number is greater than or equal to a certain value, then you can use the `greaterThan` and the `equals` options together.
An alternative is to use the `lessThan` option along with the boolean `not` option.

[NOTE]
====
The option `blank` is needed in case you have a special case when the literal `false` should be treated positively.
The need for this option arose when we wanted to create a macro supporting XML documents.
The default macro generated `<tag>` from `{tag}` when the tag was not defined.
At the same time `{tag something}` was converted to `<tag>something</tag>`.
The two different cases were separated using an `if` macro.
The definition was something like this:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define default($_,...$x)={#if
`/SEPARATOR/`$x/SEPARATOR/<$_>$x</$_>/SEPARATOR/<$_>}}\
{tag false}
----

The only problem was that the `if` macro was not able to handle the case `{tag false}`.
In that case, the evaluation results

.output
[source]
----
<tag>
----


instead of `<tag>false</tag>`.

To fix that, we need to use the option `blank` as in the following sample:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define default($_,...$x)={#if [not blank]
`/SEPARATOR/`$x/SEPARATOR/<$_>$x</$_>/SEPARATOR/<$_>}}\
{tag false}
----

This will result the desired

.output
[source]
----
<tag>false</tag>
----

The options

* `isDefined` (alias `defined`),
* `isLocal` (alias `local`),
* `isGlobal` (alias `global`),

test that the string given as the first parameter is a defined user defined macro, a locally defined macro, or a globally defined macro.
A macro is locally defined if it was defined in the same scope where the `if` is used.


The following examples show a few cases, as demonstrations:




.output
[source]
----
{@if /1/true/false}=true non-zero integer
{@if /true/true/false}=true literal true
{@if /0/true/false}=false zero integer
{@if ::true:false}=false condition is empty string
{@if :false:true:false}=false literal false
{@if :FaLSe:true:false}=false literal false
{@if :avraka kedabra:true:false}=true condition is non-empty string
{@if/0/anything can come here}= 'else' part is missing, output is empty
{@if/+1/true}=true  non-zero integer
{@if/-1/true}=true  non-zero integer
{@if/0.000/true}=true  non-empty string, floating points don't work
{@if [not blank]/false/true/false}=true true because 'false' is not blank
{@if [not empty]/false/true/false}=true true because 'false' is not empty
{@if [not]/1/true/false}=false the option 'not' can be used solitary
{@if /  /true/false}=false spaces mean false by default, but
{@if [not empty]/  /true/false}=true not empty
{@if [not blank]/  /true/false}=false is the same in this case as no option
{@if [empty]/  /true/false}=false no, not empty
{@if [not]/  /true/false}=true blank is false by default, but it is negated
{@if [blank]/  /true/false}=true is the same as the above in this case
{@if [lessThan=13]/12/true/false}=true 12 is really less than 13
{@if [lessThan=13]/13/true/false}=false 13 is not less than 13
{@if [lessThan=13 equals=13]/13/true/false}=true 13 is less than or equals 13, note the value twice
{@if [greaterThan=13 not]/13/true/false}=true 13 is not greater than 13, it is the same logic as the previous
{@if [lessThan=13 equals=14]/13/true/false}=false 13 is not less than 13 and does not equal 14
{@if [lessThan=13 and largerThan=2]/12/true/false}=true 12 is in the range (2,13)

[NOTE]
====
The above example is generated running the samples.
The composition of the sample is somewhat complex.
It uses sophisticated macros that heavily use the macro evaluation order.
These macros also check that the `if` macro really works the way it is supposed to.
If you are interested in how it looks, check the file `if.adoc.jam`.
This string appears only once in the Jamal source file.
