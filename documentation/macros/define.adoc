====

== Syntax

The syntax of the macro is the following:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define [options] macro(arguments)=value}
----

The options and the arguments are optional.
In that case, the format of the macro is

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define macro=value}
----

or

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define macro()=value}
----

Using the `()` characters after the identifier of the macro is optional, and the result is exactly the same as if it omitted.
The two definitions are equivalent.

NOTE: There is one exception, when you __have to__ use `()` even for an empty parameter list.
This is the case, when the `id` ends with a colon `:`.
In this case the definition `{@define id:=...}` would be ambiguous, because using `:=` instead of `=` has a special meaning (see it later).

The options follow the usual convention and are enclosed between `[` and `]` characters.

== Usage

The macro defines a user defined macro.
When the defined macro is used, the arguments in the body are replaced by the actual parameters supplied.
The arguments are specified as a comma-separated list.
They are usually identifiers, and it is recommended to use identifiers as arguments.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The arguments do not have any special syntax.
The only requirement is that they do not contain

* a comma `,`,
* a closing parenthesis `)`, and
* they do not start or end with `...`.

That is because the list is

* comma-separated,
* `)` terminates the list of the arguments, and
* a `...` prefix or postfix denotes optional arguments.

It is recommended, though, to use normal identifiers and no spaces in the argument names.
This is only a recommendation and is not enforced by Jamal.
You may need to process some special text where the easiest way is to use arguments that do not only use identifier characters.

You can enforce the use of only identifiers in macro arguments using the option `RestrictedDefineParameters`.
You also have no choice, but use only identifiers if you use the `default` macro option.
See the details later.
====

You may follow conventions, like starting every argument with the `*` or enclosing the argument names between `|` or `/` or some other characters.
These practices can be absolutely okay so long as long they support the readability of the macro body and the use of the macro.
Applying such practices may help to visually separate the macro arguments from the textual content of the macro body.

From practice, we see that in the cases of longer macros using simple argument names with one or only a few letters may lead to some error.
For example, the macro:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define fox(x)=The brown fox jumps over the high x}{fox fence}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
The brown fofence jumps over the high fence
----


This is probably not the result that the macro creator wanted.
They probably missed the point that the word `fox` also contains an `x` character.
One solution can be to use `$x` as the argument name.

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define fox($x)=The brown fox jumps over the high $x}{fox fence}
----

will result correctly

.output
[source]
----
The brown fox jumps over the high fence
----



To ensure that the argument replacing is consistent, the argument names cannot contain each other as a substring.

[NOTE]
====
Assume that there is an argument `a` with an actual parameter value `oneA`.
There is another argument named `aa` with an actual value `twoAs`.
In this case the occurrences of `aa` in the body could be replaced to `twoAs` or `oneAoneA`.

Although Jamal could define some rules, like left-to-right, or right-to-left, or longer-first evaluation, but these could still lead to hard-to-read situations.
Jamal suffers from hard to read situations already without this extra headache.
To avoid that Jamal does not allow `a` and `aa` as argument names to a macro definition the same time.
====

During the replacement, a parameter value may be a string that contains the name of one or more argument names.
This is absolutely legit.
The use of the macro should not, and does not depend on the names used to define the macro.
The macro parameter names inside the actual parameter values will NOT be replaced with the parameter value(s) that were provided for the other argument(s) inside the value of the parameter.
For example:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define z(*a,*b,*c,*d)=When a *a can *b, then *c can *d}
{z /leopard and a *c/run/fish/fly}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
When a leopard and a *c can run, then fish can fly
----


even though `*c` is a `fish`, but the characters `*c` in the output come from the value of a parameter, and therefore it is not replaced.

== Option `RestrictedDefineParameters`

In the example above the parameter names started with the `*` character.
These arguments are not identifiers.
Identifiers in Jamal start with the letters `a-z` or `A-Z`, `$`, `:` or underscore `_` and can contain any of these on consecutive positions and also digits.
If you want to restrict the macro definitions to use only identifiers as symbolic names for user-defined macro arguments, you can use the option  `RestrictedDefineParameters`.

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@options RestrictedDefineParameters}
{@define z($a,$b,$c,$d)=When a $a can $b, then $c can $d}
{z /leopard and a $c/run/fish/fly}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
When a leopard and a $c can run, then fish can fly
----




but the previous sample, using parameter names starting with the character `*` would result in an error.

== Macro redefine

Macros can be redefined at any point.
For example:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define a=1}{@define a=2}{a}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
2
----


It is possible to use a question mark `?` after the macro keyword `define`.
In that case, the macro is only defined if it is NOT yet defined.

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define a=1}{@define ? a=2}{a}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
1
----


It is also possible to use a `!` instead of the `?`.
In this case the macro `define` will report an error if the macro is already defined.

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define a=1}{@try! {@define! a=2}}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
The macro 'a' was already defined.
----


NOTE: The macro `try!` will catch the error and send the error message to the output.
This is mainly used for debugging and, in this case, for documentation purposes.

== Verbatim Macros

When a user defined macro is evaluated, the result of the macro is evaluated, resolving all the macros that happen to be in the result.
This can be prevented using the link:verbatim[`verbatim`] macro.
You can also read more details on the macro evaluation order in link:evaluation_order[`evaluation_order`].

If you use the `~` (tilde) character after the keyword `define`, then the macro will be evaluated "verbatim" by default.
It means that the result of the user-defined macro will not be evaluated, just like if it was used with the macro `verbatim`.
The same effect can be achieved using the option `verbatim` instead of the `~` character.

For example:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define x=1966}
{@define a={x}}
{a} evaluates first to the macro `x` and, then that evaluates to 1966
{@verbatim a} stops before the evaluation of the result of the macro and this way it is the same as
{@define ~ a={x}}{a}
or
{@define [verbatim] a={x}}{a}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
1966 evaluates first to the macro `x` and, then that evaluates to 1966
{x} stops before the evaluation of the result of the macro and this way it is the same as
{x}
or
{x}
----


If, for any reason, you need to evaluate the result of such a macro you can use the macro link:eval[`eval`] or the `!` character.
For example:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define x=1966}
{@define [verbatim] a={x}}{!a} {#eval {a}}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
1966 1966
----


[NOTE]
====
You cannot use `!` together wit the macro  `verbatim`.
The format `{!@verbatim ...}` would be the same as simply `{...}` without the `!` and the `@verbatim`.

The macros in the module Yaml define the object structures read from the Yaml format as verbatim user defined macros.
When you use such a macro, like `{yaml}` the Yaml formatted string representation of the data is the result of the macro.
Yaml itself may use the JSON compatible `{A:1, B:2, ..., X:88}` format, which Jamal may mistakenly try to interpret as a macro.
To prevent this, these Yaml data containing user defined macros are verbatim by default.
====

== Global Macros

When the name of the macro contains at least one colon character `:`, then the macro will be defined in the global scope.
Global scope is the top-level scope, and it means that a macro like that can be used everywhere in the text after it was defined.

For example, modifying our example from the documentation of the macro link:begin[`begin`]:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define A:Z=1}
{@begin alma}
{@define A:Z=2}{A:Z}
{@end alma }{A:Z}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
2
2
----


In this case the macro `A:Z` is a global macro because it has a `:` in the name.

It is also possible to define a user-defined macro to be global without `:` in the name.
If the very first character of the name of the macro is `:`, then this character is removed, but the macro is defined in the global scope.

Another version of the example:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define :Z=1}
{@begin alma}
{@define :Z=2}{Z}
{@end alma }{Z}
----

will also result:

.output
[source]
----
2
2
----


Note that you cannot use `{:Z}` when using the global macro.
The `:` character in this case is not part of the name.
Also note that you can define a local macro even if there is a global macro of the same name.

For example

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define :Z=1}
{@begin alma}
{@define Z=2}{Z}
{@end alma }{Z}
----

will result:

.output
[source]
----
2
1
----


The `define` inside the `begin`, and `end` delimited scope does not redefine the global scoped `Z`.
It defines a scope local macro, which gets out of scope with the macro `end`.

== Using Undefined Macros

If you use a user-defined macro undefined, it will result in an error.
A macro is undefined if

* it was not defined at all, or
* it was defined in a scope, and the scope is not active when the macro is used, or
* it was explicitly undefined using the link:undefine[`undefine`] macro.

You can add a `?` character in front to avoid the error.

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@try! {undefinedMacro}}
this is empty string: >>{?undefinedMacro}<<
----

which will result:

.output
[source]
----
User macro '{undefinedMacro ...' is not defined.
this is empty string: >><<
----


In that case, the result of an undefined user macro will be the empty string.
In most other cases, using an undefined user macro results an error.

If you automatically want to interpret all user-defined macro references if there was a `?` in front of them, then you can use the option `emptyUndef`.
With this option there is no need for the `?` in front of the macro name, every undefined macro will evaluate to empty string.

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@options emptyUndef}>{?notDefined}<>{notDefined}<
----

results

.output
[source]
----
><><
----


It is also possible to define a default macro that will be used when a macro is undefined.

== Default macro

If the user-defined macro `default` is defined, it will be used instead of any undefined macro, even when the `?` character is used in front of the macro name.

Example:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
>>{?hoppala}<< not defined, empty string
{@define default=wupppss}{hoppala}
>>{?hoppala}<< default macro used
----

Result:

.output
[source]
----
>><< not defined, empty string
wupppss
>>wupppss<< default macro used
----


[NOTE]
====
During the design, there were two possibilities.
One, to let the `{?...}` macro use perform the same way as if there was no defined `default` macro.
The other, to let the `{?...}` use the `default` macro.
We selected the second option because in that case, there is a fallback.
You can simply write `{#ident {@undefine default}{?...}}`.
If we selected the first option, then the `{?...}` macro would not have and alternative way to use the default macro.
====

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define default=wupppss}
{#ident {@undefine default}>>{?hoppala}<<}
>>{?hoppala}<<
----

results

.output
[source]
----
>><<
>>wupppss<<
----


Because it is cumbersome to write `{#ident {@undefine default}{?...}}` every time the option `:noUndefault` can also be used.

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define default=wupppss}\
{@options :noUndefault}>>{?hoppala}<<
{@options ~:noUndefault}>>{?hoppala}<<
----

results

.output
[source]
----
>><<
>>wupppss<<
----


The macro `default` can have arguments, and they will be handled as they should be.

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define default($x)=wupppss $x}{hoppala zumzum}
>>{?hoppala zumzum}<<
----

Result:

.output
[source]
----
wupppss zumzum
>>wupppss zumzum<<
----


Note that there can be many undefined macros, and the different macros may expect different number of parameters.
If the number of the actual parameters is not the same as what the defined `default` expects Jamal will stop with error.
Consider the use `{@options :lenient}` along with the definition of the `default` macro, or a default macro with optional arguments.

Starting with the version 1.7.4 the macro `default` can have a special first parameter.
If the first argument of the macro is named either `$macro` or `$_`, then this parameter will hold the actual macro name.
That way the `default` macro can use the name of the macro in its evaluation.

Example:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@options :lenient}
{@define default($_,$x)={@if [not empty]|$x|<$_>$x</$_>|<$_/>}}{hoppala}
{bikkala zz}
----

Result:

.output
[source]
----
<hoppala/>
<bikkala>zz</bikkala>
----


Starting with the version 1.7.6 Jamal introduced optional arguments to user-defined macros.
(Details are a bit later.)
You can use optional arguments when you define a `default` macro.
For example:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define default(...)=DEFAULT}{huppala 12}
{bumbala 1 2 3}
{wopsydosy}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
DEFAULT
DEFAULT
DEFAULT
----



== Exported Macros

When you define a macro, it gets into the local scope unless you define it global.
It is possible to export a macro after it was defined.
Exporting a macro right after the definition is so common that the option `export` of the macro `define` does the same.
For example, the following sample

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{#block
{@define A=not exported}
{@define B=exported explicitly}{@export B}
{@define [export] C=exported using option}
}
A: {?A}
B: {?B}
C: {?C}
----

will result the output

.output
[source]
----
A:
B: exported explicitly
C: exported using option
----


== Macro Parameters

When a macro is used, the parameters are the actual values for the argument symbolic names to replace them in the body of the macro.

The parameters stand after the name of the macro separated by a separator character.
The first non-whitespace and non-alphanumeric character after the name of the macro is the separator character.
It can be `/` as in the examples below, but it can also be any non-alphanumeric character.
The number of parameters should be exactly the same as the number of arguments unless

* the `{@options :lenient}` was specified, or
* the `...` was used to denote optional arguments.

In the case of optional arguments, the missing arguments will be zero-length strings.
If there are extra parameters, they will be ignored.

The separator character cannot be an alphanumeric character (letter or digit, Unicode categories Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo, and Nd).
Any other Unicode character can be used as a parameter separator character.

There is a special case, when a macro has exactly one argument.
In this case, it is possible to omit the separator character if the parameter starts with an alphanumeric character.

The one parameter of the macro can start after the name of the macro with the first non-whitespace, alphanumeric character.

For example,

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define enclose(a)=<!!a!!>}
{enclose this text}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
<!!this text!!>
----


The parameter, in this case, should start with an alphanumeric character or with a macro start string.
If it starts with something else, then that character will be the separator character that separates the parameters.
In this case, because there is only one parameter, it will separate the macro name from the parameter.
For example,

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define enclose(a)=<!!a!!>}
{enclose /-}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
<!!-!!>
----


Writing

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{enclose -}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
<!!!!>
----


because `-` is not alphanumeric, and therefore it is treated as a separator character separating a single empty string.
On the other hand

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define enclose(a)=<!!a!!>}
{@define dash=-}
{enclose {dash}}
----

will work, and the result will be

.output
[source]
----
<!!-!!>
----


This is because the `{` in this case is the macro start string.
This is a special case, and in this case, the first character of it is not considered to be a separator character even if it is not alphanumeric.

There are cases when it is necessary to use a separator character:

* When the provided parameter value starts with significant spaces,

* it starts with not alphanumeric character.

In that cases, the above macro should be used like the following three examples:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{enclose |+this text}
{enclose ||this text}
{enclose | this text}
----

These uses of the above macro will result

.output
[source]
----
<!!+this text!!>
<!!|this text!!>
<!! this text!!>
----


In the second line in the examples, the separator character is used in the parameter.
Because the macro needs only one argument all the rest of the parameter until the macro closing string is used as the single parameter.
It is not split up further along the later occurrences of the separator character.
Just use any non-alphanumeric character in front of the parameter that looks good.
You need not worry that the character itself presents in the content.

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@options ~lenient}
{@define x(a,b)= |a b|}
{@try!{x/s/h/t}}
----

will result in an error because there are too many arguments:

.output
[source]
----
Macro 'x' needs 2 arguments and got 3
>>>s
>>>h
>>>t
----


The rule that the separator character is not considered as another separator in the rest of the argument is valid only

* for single argument macros, and

* when the macro was defined using the option `tail` in the `define` macro.

In the case of multiple arguments, this could easily lead to unreadable macro use.
The above example modified to be lenient demonstrates this:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define x(a,b)= |a b|}{@options :lenient}
{x/s/h/t}
----


will result

.output
[source]
----
|s h|
----


The provided third value, `t` is ignored.

There are situations where the use of a separator character is not a must, but the use of it helps the readability.
Consider, For example, `{enclose/a/b/v}`.
We know  from earlier that `enclose` has only one argument, however, the use of it looks like it has three.
The one argument it has is `a/b/v`.

Omitting the separator character, `/` in this case, does not help the readability or only a bit.
The use `{enclose a/b/c}` still looks like a macro with three parameters.
In situations like that, the most readable solution is to use an explicit separator character that looks good.
For example, `{enclose |a/b/c}` makes it evident and readable that there is only one parameter: `a/b/c`.

In the following sample code, you can see some complex examples that demonstrate these cases:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define parameterless=this is a simple macro} macro defined
{parameterless}
{@define withparams(a,b,%66h)=this is a b %66h} macro defined
{withparams/A/more complex/macro}
{withparams/%66h/%66h/zazu} <- %66h is not replaced to zazu in the parameters
{@define? withparams(a,b,c)=abc}here 'withparams' is not redefined
{withparams|a|b|c}
{#block {@define x=local}{@define :x=global} {#define :y=here we are {x}}}
{y}
here we are {x}
----

will generate

.output
[source]
----
 macro defined
this is a simple macro
 macro defined
this is A more complex macro
this is %66h %66h zazu <- %66h is not replaced to zazu in the parameters
here 'withparams' is not redefined
this is a b c

here we are local
here we are global
----


This is a fairly complex example.
To ease the understanding, note the following:

1. `%66h` is an absolutely valid macro parameter name.
Anything can be a parameter name that does not contain a comma, a closing parentheses, does not start or end with `...` and is not a substring of any other parameter.

2. When a macro parameter is replaced in the body of the macro the processing of that string is finished and is not processed further replacing macro parameters.
Macro parameters are only replaced with the actual values in the macro body and not in the parameter actual values.
That is why parameters `a` and `b` are replaced with the actual string ' %66h' but, then this is not replaced with the actual value of the parameter `%66h`.

3. When we define the macros `x` and `y` inside the `comment` macro it happens in a local scope of the `comment` macro.
It means that the definition of `x` has no effect outside the macro `comment`.
Using the name `:x` defines the macro `x` in the global scope, that is above the current scope.
When we defined the macro `y` it also starts with `:`
and so it gets into the global scope.
However, during the definition, it is in the local scope of the `comment` macro where the local definition of `x` overrides the global definition of `x` even though the global definition happened later.
Therefore, `y` will be `here we are local`.
That is also because  `y` is defined using the `#` character before the built-in macro keyword `define` and thus the content of the definition is evaluated before defining the global `y`.

== Pure Macros

It may happen that the macro opening and closing strings are different when the macro is defined and when used.
In a situation like that, the macro evaluation replaces the macro opening and closing strings in the macro definition to the actual macro opening and closing strings.
Use `:=` instead of a `=` between the name, or parameter list and the body of the macro to prevent this replacement, or use the `[pure]` option.

In the following example we will set the macro opening and closing string to `|` and `.` using the link:sep[`sep`] macro.

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@sep | .}|@define a=|z.{z}.|@sep.{@define z=3}{a}
{@sep | .}|@define a():=|z.{z}.|@sep.{@define z=3}{a}
{@sep | .}|@define [pure]a=|z.{z}.|@sep.{@define z=3}{a}
----

results in

.output
[source]
----
3{z}
|z.3
|z.3
----


When `a` is evaluated the result is `|z.{z}` on both lines.
In the next step this result is evaluated, because the macro is not a `verbatim` one.
In the first case the macro a normal one and the evaluation knows that the macro opening and closing strings were `|` and `.`.
In this case the evaluation also knows that the characters `{` and `}` are just ordinary characters.

In the second and the third case, however, the macro is a "pure" macro.
It is evaluated using the actual macro opening and closing strings.

Note that when there are no parameters, and the macro definition does not use the optional `()` after the name of the macro the `:=` would be ambiguous.
To avoid this ambiguity, you have to use `()` after the name of the macro if the name of the macro finishes with a `:` character.


== Optional Arguments

Setting the option `lenient` is a very aggressive way to make all macros inside the current scope evaluated in the lenient way.
There are more subtle methods to specify that some macros may work with less or more actual parameter values than their concrete arguments.
Macros can define a minimum, and a maximum number of parameters they need when they are called.
When an argument in the `define` macro starts with `...` characters it means that the next argument, and the arguments afterward are optional.
These arguments will be empty string when no values are provided. For example,

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@options ~lenient}make sure option lenient is not set
{@define a(a,b,...c,d,e)=>1:"a" 2:"b" 3:"c" 4:"d" 5:"e"}
{a :A:B:C}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
make sure option lenient is not set

>1:"A" 2:"B" 3:"C" 4:"" 5:""
----


You can also say that all the parameters are optional in case the `...` is in front of the first argument:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define a(...a,b,c,d,e)=1:"a" 2:"b" 3:"c" 4:"d" 5:"e"}
{a :A:B:C:D:E}
{a :A:B:C:D}
{a :A:B:C}
{a :A:B}
{a :A}
{a}
----

will result

.output
[source]
----
1:"A" 2:"B" 3:"C" 4:"D" 5:"E"
1:"A" 2:"B" 3:"C" 4:"D" 5:""
1:"A" 2:"B" 3:"C" 4:"" 5:""
1:"A" 2:"B" 3:"" 4:"" 5:""
1:"A" 2:"" 3:"" 4:"" 5:""
1:"" 2:"" 3:"" 4:"" 5:""
----


Optional parameters are different from leinent mode, that they do not allow extra parameters. For example, the

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@try! {a :A:B:C:D:E:F}}
----

will result the error

.output
[source]
----
Macro 'a' needs (0 ... 5) arguments and got 6
>>>A
>>>B
>>>C
>>>D
>>>E
>>>F
----


If you want to allow extra parameters, then you can append `...` after the last argument:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define a(...a,b,c,d,e...)=1:"a" 2:"b" 3:"c" 4:"d" 5:"e"}

Appending `...` after some other argument, which is not the last one or using `...` prefix on more than one argument is an error.
It is also an error to add `...` postfix after the first argument when the macro has one argument.
One argument macros are treated in a special way and all the text following the macro will be treated as a single argument, thus it is meaningless to use `...` after a single argument.

== Options (parops)

The version 1.12.3 introduced options to the macro `define`.
The options you can use are:

* `verbatim` says that the macro is verbatim.
you can use this option instead of the `~` character.

* `optional`, `ifNotDefined` says that the macro is optional.
You can use this option instead of the `?` character.

* `pure` says that the macro is pure.
You can use this option instead of the `:=` assignment.

* `noRedefine`, `fail`, `noRedef`, `failIfDefined` says that the macro should not be redefined.
You can use this option instead of the `!` character.
The option `noRedefine` can also be used in the link:options[`options`] macro setting this behaviour for all the macros defined after it within the scope of the option.

* `tail` says that the macro parameters should be parsed splitting the input string into exactly the number of the arguments.
If there are more separator characters, then those became part of the last argument.
Care should be exercised when using this option because it can lead to hard to read macro invocations.

* `global` says that the macro should be defined in the global scope.

* `export` says that the macro should be exported right after it was defined.
In other words, the macro will be defined in the surrounding scope instead of the current one.

* `class` says that the macro should be defined by the implementing class.

* `default`, `defaults`, `named` gives default values to the parameters.
In this case, the syntax of the macro invocation is different from the usual one.
The use of this parop is described in detail in the next section.

These options are technically aliases, meaning that none of them can be defined as a global option or as a macro.
Was it a name, the special macro `default` would collide with the parop `default`.

It is generally recommended to use the options instead of the modifying characters.
The modifying characters remain part of the language for backward compatibility.

You cannot use an option and the respective modifying character at the same time.
However, you can use one of the modifying characters and the other option, unless they are mutually exclusive (`?` and `!`).

The option `global` makes the macro global, even if the macro does not have a `:` in the name.
Using the option as `global=false`, however, will not make a macro containing one or more `:` characters local.
This option can be used together with the name containing `:`.

== Default Parameters

The option `named` can be used to create a user-defined macro that ues named parameters.
When this option is used, the macro invocation has a different syntax.
In this case, the parameters are given with the names in a similar syntax to the parops of the built-in macros.

For example:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define [named] Z(a=1,b=2,c=3)=a b c}{Z a=4 c=5}
----

will result in

.output
[source]
----
4 2 5
----


The parameter option parsing, as described in the document link:../PAROPS.adoc[Parameter Options], is used to fetch the values of the parameters.
The default values are used only if the parameter is not provided.

The macros defined using the `named` option can not be serialized.
It means that they cannot be used, for example, with the snippet library `reference` macro.

NOTE: The syntax and use of default parameters was experimental in the release 2.4.0 and it changed.

== Special User Defined Macros

[WARNING]
====
This section is about "user-defined" macros returned by some built-in macros of some external packages.
They behave like special user-defined macros, but they are not defined using the `define` macro.
This section is important for you only if you want to understand how user-defined macros work under the hood, or want to create your own user-defined macros in Java.
====

In Jamal user defined macros are defined using the `define` macro.
The Java code implementing the macro `define` create Java objects for every defined user defined macro.
Other macros can also create "user defined" macros.
The Jamal engine will handle any Java object that is of a class implementing two interfaces:

* `Identified`, and
* `Evaluable`.

These are the major features required from a user defined macro.
They have to be registered by a name in the Jamal engine, hence they need to implement the `Identified` interface, and they have to evaluate to a string, hence they need to implement the `Evaluable` interface.

Some built-in macros implemented in external packages, like the Yaml package, or the counters in the snippet package have their own implementation.
It means that they create user defined macros that you can pass parameters to, and their evaluation results some output, but they are not "classical" user defined macros.
They just behave like the macros that are defined using `define`.

For example, the macro `counter:define` from the Snippet package creates a "user-defined" macro that results a number when used, but it also changes the value at every invocation magically.

Starting with the release 2.3.0 the macro `define` supports the option `class`.
This option can provide the class name that implements the macro.
The class, eventually has to implement the `Identified` and `Evaluable` interfaces.
It can implement the `Configurable` interface.
If it does, then it will be configured with the parameters:

* `"id"` providing a string with the macro identifier as defined in the `define` macro.
* `"verbatim"` will be either `true` or `false` depending on the value of the `verbatim` option of the `define` macro.
* `"tail"`  will be either `true` or `false` depending on the value of the `tail` option of the `define` macro.
* `"params"` will be an array of strings with the parameter names as defined in the `define` macro.
* `"processor"` will be the processor that is used to evaluate the `define` macro.
* `"input"` will be the input of the `define` macro following the `=` sign.

The configuration calls the method `configure()` with the listed configuration keys as a strings and object values as parameters.
