= Standard Built-In Macro Argument Splitting


== Introduction

Some Built-in macros use special syntax.
Others split the input into parts and use the parts to work with.
The splitting is standardized and is implemented by Jamal to support these macros.
This way these macros use the same input splitting algorithm.

In other words, the algorithm described in this document is how many built-in macros get their arguments.
For example the macro `if` can be used as follows:

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@if /true/then/else}
----

which will result in the output

.output
[source]
----
then
----


In this case the input `/true/then/else` is split into three parts `true`, `then` and `else`.
The separation is done using the first character following the macro.
This is the most common and simplest way to separate the arguments, but there is more to it.

== The Algorithm

The algorithm is defined in the following way:

* If the first non-white space character is a letter or digit, then the input is split along the white space characters.
Multiple adjacent white space characters are counted as one.
The splitting does not create empty parameters.
+
.Jamal source
[source]
----
..{@if true then else}..
----
+
.output
[source]
----
..then..
----

+
NOTE: No spaces around the output `then`.

* If the first non-white space character is backtick (`++`++`), then the parsing expects a regular expression between backticks.
After the regular expression and after the closing backtick, the rest of the input is split up using the regular expression as separator.
Backticks inside the regular expression have to be doubled.
+
.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@if `\s*THEN\s*|\s*ELSE\s*` true THEN then ELSE else}
----
+
.output
[source]
----
then
----


* If the first non-whitespace character is not a letter or digit or backtick (`++`++`), then the first non-whitespace character is the separator.
+
.Jamal source
[source]
----
..{@if /true/  then  /else}..
----
+
.output
[source]
----
..  then  ..
----

+
NOTE: There are spaces around the output `then`.

* If the macro `$REGEX` is defined (no arguments) then its content will be used as regular expression to split the input.
+
.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@define $REGEX=\s*THEN\s*|\s*ELSE\s*}
{@if  true THEN then ELSE else}
----
+
.output
[source]
----
then
----


Some macros may decide to use the splitting in a way that ignores the last rule.
Unless it is documented so, you should assume that these four rules apply.

== Java Background

NOTE: You can ignore this part if you are not interested in the Java details.
This section is for those who want to implement their own macros in Kotlin or Java.

Built-in macros are implemented in Java or Kotlin.
Jamal itself is implemented in Java.
When you develop macros in Kotlin, you can call the Java methods, or you can use the Jamal Kotlin library.
This library provides a lightweight facáde to the Java implementation enabling Kotlin style development.

Each macro is a class implementing the interface `Macro`.
The interface has the method named `evaluate()`.
This method is invoked to process the input and result in the output.

Technically the `input` parameter of the method `evaluate()` is not a string.
It is an instance of some class implementing the interface `Input`.
The interface `input` extends the Java interface `CharSequence`.
That way, `input` behaves like a string.

The Java code of the macro is free to interpret this string the way it wants.
Different macros implement their syntax analysis differently.

To manage the input and ease the syntax analysis and interpretation of the input, there is a utility class named `InputHandler`.
This class defines a method named `getParts()` which does a simple analysis.
It splits the input into an array of strings in a "standard" way, as described above.

This method is used, for example, by the implementation of the `if` built-in macro.
I recommend using this method when there is no special requirement for a macro.
Using this method provides a concise way for macro argument separation.

The method `getParts()` is overloaded.
It has four versions:

* `getParts(Input input, Processor processor)` — This is the most general version.
It splits the input to as many parts as possible according to the rules described above.
It also uses the last rule looking up the macro `$REGEX`.

* `getParts(Input input, Processor processor, int limit)` — This version splits the input as many partds as spossible, but not more than `limit` parts.
That way, the last part may contain separators.

* `getParts(Input input)` — Same as the one with the `Processor` argument, but it does not care the `$REGEX` macro.

* `getParts(Input input, int limit)` — Same as the one with the `Processor` argument, but it does not care the `$REGEX` macro.

It is recommended to use one of the versions that do use the `$REGEX` macro.

Some of the built-in macros use this method to split the value of some parops.
For example, the macros `replace`, and `replaceLine` use the method to split the value of the parop `replace` into parts.
They enclose the string value of the parop in an `Input` object before calling `getParts()`.

For the Kotlin support methods have look at the Kotlin file
