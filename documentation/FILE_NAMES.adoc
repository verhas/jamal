= Resource Files and Web Resources

Macros can reference files.
For example, the core macros link:macros/include.adoc[`include`] and link:macros/import.adoc[`import`] use file names and include and import those files.
A file name can be absolute file name and relative to the file in which it is used.
The file names should be denoted the usual UNIX way, using forwards slash characters `/` as directory separators.
This is supported by the different Windows operating systems as well, as Linux and macOS.

In addition to the local files, Jamal can also load files from other locations.
To do that, Jamal implements an extensible mechanism.
Whenever a file name starts with a special prefix, then Jamal uses a special handler to load the file.
There are handlers implemented for the following prefixes:

* `res:` to load files from the Java resources,
* `https:` to download files from the web,
* `maven:` to load files from the Maven repository,
* `jar:file:` to load files from a JAR file, or
* `__some other prefix:__` to load files using a custom handler.

These files are treated in a special way.

The handlers, even those implemented in Jamal already, are loaded automatically via the ServiceLoader mechanism.
It means that anyone can extend Jamal implementing new handlers reading files from different sources.

NOTE: The prefix used by a custom handler has to be at least three characters long not to confuse the syntax with the Windows drive letters.

The following subsections detail the mechanism for the implemented handlers.

== Java Resource Files

When the file name starts with the characters `res:` it is a Java resource file.
The typical use of it is when a macro package contains built-in as well as user-defined macros.
In this case the user-defined macros are defined in `jim` files, inside the Java JAR.

Technically, any resource can be loaded from the classpath.

== Loading Resources from `maven:load` loaded libraries

Starting with version 2.0.0, it is possible to load macros from Maven artifacts using the macro `maven:load`.
The resources in these artifacts are not on the classpath.
In this case, the application uses different classloaders to load the macro classes that are usable by default and those loaded with the `maven:load` macro.
Jamal uses the application class loader to load resources using the `res:` prefix unless otherwise instructed (see below).
This classloader does not see the dynamically loaded classes and resources.

To load a resource from a dynamically loaded library, the `res:` prefix has to be followed by the name of a macro enclosed between `pass:[`]` backtick characters before the resource name.
That way, the resource loading will use the class loader, which loaded the macro and will eventually find the resource in the dynamically loaded library.

== Web Resources

Web resources can be downloaded using the `https:` prefix.
The only protocol supported is `https`.
Jamal does not download any resource using the unencrypted `HTTP` protocol.

=== Caching Web Resources

It is possible to cache the downloaded files.
The environment variable

  JAMAL_HTTPS_CACHE

can define a directory to store the web resources.
The default cache directory is

  ~/.jamal/cache/

If the cache directory exists, Jamal will store the downloaded files in it.
Jamal will create the subdirectories it needs, but Jamal will never create the cache directory itself.

NOTE: If you do not want to use the caching, then do not create the cache directory.

=== Cache eviction and expiration

Jamal will not cache a downloaded files that has `SNAPSHOT` in the URL (all capital letters).
There is no cache eviction or expiration by default.
You can find the files in the cache directory in the

  ~/.jamal/cache/https

subdirectory.
For each cached file under the `https` directory there is a property file under the

  ~/.jamal/cache/properties

directory.
The name of the file is exactly the same as the named of the cached file.
There is no "properties" or any special extension.
For example, the cache file


  ~/.jamal/cache/https/com/githubusercontent/raw/verhas/jamal/master/jamal-snippet/src/main/resources/kroki.jim

contains the downloaded content of the file

  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verhas/jamal/master/jamal-snippet/src/main/resources/kroki.jim

and the properties file is

  ~/.jamal/cache/properties/com/githubusercontent/raw/verhas/jamal/master/jamal-snippet/src/main/resources/kroki.jim

The properties files contain information about when a file was stored in the cache and also when it was last time read.
It is also possible to define Time To Live (TTL) for the cache items.

Ttl value can be defined with the `ttl` property key.
The value can be a raw number expressing the ttl in seconds or a string with time unit(s).
The units are:

* `y` for year(s) (365 days)

* `M` for month(s) (31 days)

* `w` for week(s) (7 days)

* `d` for day(s) (24 hours)

* `h` for hour(s) (60 minutes)

* `m` for minute(s) (60 seconds)

* `s` for second(s)

If you use multiple time units, then the value is the sum of the time units.
The units should be used in `Y`, `M`, `w`, `d`, `h`, `m`, `s` order.
You can omit the units that have zero value.
You can use any number in front of a unit, you are not limited with the natural number of time units.
For example, you can say `1d25h` for 1 day and 25 hours, which is exactly the same as `2d1h`

Examples:

* `13y` means 13 years

* `13y1M3h` means 13 years, 1 month and 3 hours

=== TTL hierarchy

You can define TTL values for the whole cache, for a group of files and for a single file.
When you define a TTL value for a single file, you edit the properties file of the file.
When you define a TTL value for a group of files, you edit the properties file of the directory.
When you define a TTL value for the whole cache, you edit the properties file of the cache root directory.

The name of the properties file for a directory is `.properties` and it is in the directory.
These files are not created by Jamal, but you are free to create them with different keys and values.

The property values, `ttl` or other values, are read from the property file and are inherited from `.properties` files.
The `.properties` files can be created in the different cache directories up to the root directory of the properties.
When a key is defined in multiple `.properties` files, then the value closer to the properties file of the cached item is used.
If the key is defined in the properties file of the cached item, then the value is used.
This way you can define the TTL for a specific cache item, a group of items and for the whole cache.

The connection to the web can also be configured if needed.
The environment variables that can be used are the following:

* `JAMAL_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, and

* `JAMAL_READ_TIMEOUT`

can define two timeout values for the web download in millisecond as unit.

The default value for the timeouts is 5000, meaning five seconds.

The proxy setting can be configured using standard Java system properties.
For more information see the JavaDoc documentation of the class `java.net.HttpURLConnection` in the JDK documentation.
Jamal does not set any proxy settings.

== Maven resources

When the name of the file stats with the characters `maven:`, then Jamal tries to find the file in the Maven repository.
You can use file names like

.Jamal source
[source]
----
{@include [verbatim] maven:com.javax0.jamal:jamal-groovy:1.12.5:compile:version.properties}
----


which will result

.output
[source]
----
version=1.12.5
----


For more information read the link:../jamal-maven-input/README.adoc[documentation] of the module implementing the `maven:` prefix.

== JAR resources

Jamal can read files from JAR files.
In this case the prefix has to be `jar:file:` and the file name has to be the name of the JAR file followed by the name of the file inside the JAR file following a `!` character.

For more information read the link:../jamal-jar-input/README.adoc[documentation] of the module implementing the `jar:file:` prefix.
