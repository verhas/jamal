= Starting with Jamal in 5 minutes

The easiest way is to use Jamal is the IntelliJ IDEA Asciidoctor plugin with the Jamal extension.

== Installing the plugin

The installation of Jamal needs downloading the ZIP file

https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/javax0/jamal/jamal-asciidoc/2.3.0/jamal-asciidoc-2.3.0-jamal-asciidoc-distribution.zip[``https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/javax0/jamal/jamal-asciidoc/2.3.0/jamal-asciidoc-2.3.0-jamal-asciidoc-distribution.zip``]

and extracting it to the project directory under `.asciidoctor/lib` directory.
You may need to configure the Asciidoctor plugin to recognize the files with the extension `.jam` as Asciidoc files.
The detailed steps are described in the documentation link:../jamal-asciidoc/README.adoc[Jamal Asciidoc extension].

Optionally, you can also install the live templates, also described in the documentation.

== Starting up

After the configuration you just need to start IntelliJ and create a new file named `README.adoc.jam` in the project.
The plugin and the preprocessor will automatically start.

The content of the file can be the following:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------------
= README.adoc.jam

//{%@rot13 QB ABG RQVG GUVF SVYR; GUVF VF TRARENGRQ SEBZ FNZCYR_ERNQZR.nqbp.wnz%}

{%@snip:xml pom=../pom.xml%}\
{%#define VERSION={%pom /project/version/text()%}%}\

This is a sample readme of the version `{%VERSION%}`.



----------------------------------------

This file contains a comment line.
It is encrypted in the source code and decrypted in the generated file.
It uses the `rot13` macro to encode the text.
The encoded text is:
----
//DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE; THIS IS GENERATED FROM SAMPLE_README.adoc.jam

----

This is a neat trick to have this text in the generated file without having the same in the source.
When you read the source, it is a gibberish.
When you read in the generated file, it is a rclear warning.

It is also a simple demonstration of a simple macro.

The next thing is a snippet collection.
In this case  we collect an XML snippet into the snippet named `pom`.
The next line uses the `define` macro to define `VERSION`.
The content of the macro is the version from the `pom.xml` file.

The last line shows how to use this defined macro.

The result, processed by Jamal finally is:

[source,asciidoc]
----------------------------------------
= README.adoc.jam

//DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE; THIS IS GENERATED FROM SAMPLE_README.adoc.jam


How to use Jamal in five minutes.
This is a sample readme of the version `2.3.1-SNAPSHOT`.



----------------------------------------

With this, you started using Jamal in five minutes.
Here we used three macros, but there are around 200 different macros in the library.
You can also create your own macros.
