= Jamal API


You can embed Jamal into Java application using Java 11 and later.

You need the Jamal libraries on your classpath.
If you use Maven, you can simply have

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.javax0.jamal</groupId>
    <artifactId>jamal-engine</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

in your pom file.

The library `jamal-engine` transitively depends on the other libraries that are needed (`jamal-core`, `jamal-api` and `jamal-tools`).

You also have to specify that you use the modules if your code uses modules.

[source]
----
module jamal.maven {
requires jamal.api;
requires jamal.tools;
requires jamal.engine;
}
----

You can instantiate a `Processor` object to process the input.

[source,java]
----
import javax0.jamal.engine.Processor;

var processor=new Processor(macroOpen,macroClose);
var result=processor.process(input);
----

The `macroOpen` and `macroClose` parameters are `String` values.
The parameter `input` to the method `process()` has to be an object that implements the `javax0.jamal.api.Input` interface.
The easiest way to do that is to use the readily available class `javax0.jamal.tools.Input`.

You can see an example to create an `Input` from an existing file in the `jamal-maven-plugin` module:

[source,java]
----
result = processor.process(
        new javax0.jamal.tools.Input(
                Files.readString(inputPath, StandardCharsets.UTF_8),
                new Position(inputPath.toString(), 1)));
----

An `Input` holds the content the processor has to process.
It also has a reference file name used to resolve the absolute names of the included and imported files.
It also keeps track of the line number, and the column of the actual character as the macro evaluation progresses.
A `new Position(s,1)` creates a new position that identifies the file by the name `s` and the line number 1.

When a new processor is instantiated, it uses the `ServiceLoader` mechanism to find all the built-in macros that are on the classpath.
If your application has special macros implemented in Java, then you can just put the library on the `modulepath`.
If the classes are defined in the `provides` directive of the module, then Jamal will find and load them automatically.

It is also possible to define user-defined and built-in macros via API.
To do that you need access to the `MacroRegister` object that the `Processor` object has.
To get that you can invoke the method `getRegister()` on the processor object:

[source]
----
var register=processor.getRegister();
----

The register has API to define macros and user-defined macros.
For further information, see the API JavaDoc documentation.

== Using Jamal as a templating engine

There is a very simple API class that makes it possible to use Jamal as a templating engine.
The utility class `javax0.jamal.Format` has the method
`public static String format(String content, Map<String, String> predefinedMacros)`
that can format the `content` string using the entries of the `predefinedMacros` as user-defined macros.
These macros eventually cannot have arguments.
This is a simplified interface to access the functionality of Jamal.

== Document Converter API

The class, `DocumentConverter` supports document converting.
This is usually done during the build process in the unit test phase.
The practice is to create one or more unit tests converting the project `.jam` files.

The method `convert(file)` converts the file given as argument.
The resulting file will be created in the same directory as the original file with the `.jam` extra extension chopped off.
For example, if you convert `README.adoc.jam`, then the resulting file will be `README.adoc`.

The other method `convertAll(file)` converts many files.
It takes two arguments, both are lists of file name endings.
The first is the file endings (extensions) to include, the second one is the file endings (extensions) to exclude.
The two static methods `include()` and `exclude()` can be used to create these arguments.
