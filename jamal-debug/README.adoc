= Jamal Debugger

The module `jamal-engine` implements the support for the debugger implementations since Jamal version 1.7.3
The debuggers are implemented in the `jamal-debug` module.

NOTE: This document is developer documentation.
There is no need to understand the details outlined in this document to use Jamal or the debugger.
This documentation is maintained with lower priority than user documentation.
For this reason this documentation may not be up-to-date.

To use the Jamal debugger, start it so that the

* Debugger module is on the classpath, or on the module path, e.g.: use `jbang`.
When Jamal starts with jbang, it automatically puts a lot of modules including the debugger on the classpath.

* Start Jamal in a way that it looks for debugger modules and uses it, e.g. use the option `jbang jamal@verhas --debug=http:8080` with jbang.

+
Alternatively you can specify the environment variable `JAMAL_DEBUG` to be `http:8080`.

* Start your web browser and open the page `http://localhost:8080`.
The port is the one you specified in the debug option.
You are free to choose any port that is not used by other programs.

== How to Use the Jamal debugger

The actual use of the Jamal debugger is not documented in a textual way.
From the user point of view it is a straightorward to use web application.
The rest of this documentation describes how the debugger works inside Jamal.
It is a more architectural description than a users' guide.

== How Jamal debugger works

When the application creates a Processor, it looks at the environment variable `JAMAL_DEBUG`.
This variable can either be missing or be the empty string or may contain a debugger connection string.
If the variable is not defined or blank, the processor will use the "null debugger" that does nothing.

If this variable is defined and not empty, the processor searches for a debugger to handle the connection string.
Debuggers are loaded using the service loader, and they have to implement the `javax0.jamal.api.Debugger` interface.

The processor invokes the method `affinity(s)` for each the available debuggers.
The argument `s` is the connection string.
The method returns an integer number, and the more the debugger thinks it can handle the connection string, the smaller number it returns.

If the returned value is -1, then the debugger cannot handle the connection string at all.
The processor will select the debugger that returns the smallest non-negative number.

The null debugger is implemented in the engine module.
It returns `Integer.MAX_VALUE-1` for any connection string.
If no other debugger thinks they can handle a connection, then Jamal will use the null-debugger.

It is an error if two or more debuggers report the same minimal, non-negative affinity.

Usually, debuggers return `1000` if they can handle a string and `-1` if not.
The whole affinity number is a way of over engineering, but it works, tested and there is no reason to unimplement it.

The connection string has the general format

[source,text]
----
type:p1:p2: ... :pn?o1=v1&o2=v2&...&oj=vk
----

The `type` part is a string identifier, and usually, this is the part that a debugger looks at to decide if it can handle a connection.
For example, the TCP Server Debugger handles all connection strings with the `s:` characters.
The HTTP Server Debugger handles all connection strings that start with the `http:` characters.

The parameters `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn` and the options `o1`, `o2`, ... `oj` are interpreted by the debugger.

When Jamal starts with a debugger, the processor is regularly invoking the debugger at specific points.
It passes

* the current state of the input before the evaluation of a text block or macroblock, before evaluating a macro or text block;

* the macro body or the text that is to be evaluated before evaluating a macro or text block;

* the current state of the output and the input's current state after evaluating a macro or text block.

The debugger implementations are free to stop and interact with the debugger client at these points.
The TCP Server Debugger and the HTTP Server Debugger stop and interact with the debugger client only after the macro evaluation.

== TCP Server Debugger

The TCP server debugger starts to listen on a TCP port and accepts commands via telnet.
It was designed having a native UI implementation of the debugger client.
Currently, there is no native implementation of the debugger UI.
The TCP debugger is an experimental feature.

The input and output commands are textual, but not human friendly.
For example, you have to specify the length of the strings in a decimal length-encoded format.
E.g. a ten-character string has to be preceeded with the characters `210`.

To ease the use of the interface for humans directly typing in commands the debugger can switch to human mode using the `h` command.

To start Jamal with the TCP server debugger use a connection string, like

[source,text]
----
           s:8080
----
The TCP debugger will handle all connection strings that start with the characters `s:`.
The `p1` parameter is the port that the server will listen on.
You can connect to `localhost:p1` using telnet.

The commands are single characters.
When there is a string in the command, or in the response, it has the format

[source,text]
----
nNtttttttt
----

Here

* `n` is a single digit between `0` to `9` and denotes the number of characters in `N`

* `N` is the decimal representation using ASCII characters `0` to `9` of the length of `tttttttt`.

* `tttttttt` is the text.

The debugger can also switch to "human" more where the length is not sent in front of the strings and are also not expected.
In this case, the strings, which are parameters of a command, last till the end of the line.
This way, someone can debug a code using a telnet command and issue the `x` command (execute) without counting the number of characters.

The command `H` switches the operation to "human" mode.
To switch back from human-mode to machine mode, the Jamal processor has to be restarted.
It usually means restarting the whole application unless the application supports Jamal processor restarting.

=== TCP Server Debugger Commands

* `q` will quit the debugger and then terminates the Jamal processor throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`.

* `r` will stop debugging and run the rest of the Jamal processing till the processor terminates.

* `s` will ask the debugger to step one macro evaluation further.
If this step includes macro evaluation inside the currently evaluated macros, the stepping will not stop there.


* `S` will ask the debugger to step one macro evaluation, further stepping into the nested macro evaluations.

* `i` will display the current content of the input.

* `I` will display the content of the input right before the evaluation of the current macro

* `o` will display the content of the output after the macro evaluation.
It is the output of the last macro evaluation and not the whole output.

* `m` will display the currently evaluated macro before evaluation.
The macro after the evaluation is the output.

* `l` will display the current macro nesting level.

* `x` will execute Jamal input following the command

* `b` will list the built-in macros for all the nesting levels

* `u` will list the user-defined macros for all the nesting levels

* `h` will send a help message

== HTTP Server Debugger

Use a connection string, like

[source,text]
----
           http:8080?client=127.0.0.1&cors=*
----

The HTTP server debugger will handle a connection string if it starts with `http:`.
The `p1` parameter (the `8080` in the example) is the port, so the server listens for incoming HTTP requests on `localhost:p1`.
The URLs have the format `http://localhost:p1/command`.

The connection string can also contain two options:

. `client` is the address, as a string of the accepted client.
Connections coming from a different client are refused.
Usually, it is `127.0.0.1`.
+
To see the actual string that the debugger sees GET `http://localhost:p1/client`.
The debugger will answer with the actual string as it sees your client.
Then stop the debugger and configure this string to be safe using the `client=...` option.

. `cors` is the option to add an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the responses.
The default is not to add this header.
It is necessary if you start the JavaScript code of the debugger from a different server.
This is mainly during the development of the debugger application, so generally you do not need this option.
+
You may use `"` around the `cors` parameters if you run Jamal on Unix from shell and you use `*`.

=== HTTP Server Debugger Commands

The commands are URL queries in this case.
Each URL can be queried either using the method a `GET` or `POST` as documented.
If you use any other method than the one the command handles, you will get an error.

The documentation of the commands will include the URL, the usable method, either `GET` or `POST`, never both, the supposed content of the request if there is any required, the content of the response.

* `/level` `GET` *body:* none, *response body:* the current macro nesting level as a decimal number.
Content type is `text/plain`.

* `/input` `GET` *body:* none, *response body:* the current content of the input.
Content type is `text/plain`.

* `/inputBefore` `GET` *body:* none, *response body:* the content of the input right before the evaluation of the current macro.
Content type is `text/plain`.

* `/output` `GET` *body:* none, *response body:* the output content after the macro evaluation.
It is the output of the last macro evaluation and not the whole output.
Content type is `text/plain`.

* `/processing` `GET` *body:* none, *response body:* the currently evaluated macro before evaluation.
The macro after the evaluation is the output.
Content type is `text/plain`.

* `/macros` `GET` *body:* none, *response body:* the built-in macros for all the nesting levels
Content type is `application/json`.
A typical response JSON is

[source,json]
----
{
  "macros": [
    [
      "import",
      "use",
...
      "comment",
      "try",
      "hello",
      "begin"
    ],
    [
      "snip",
      "snip:define"
    ]
  ]
}
----

In the example above, the built-in core macros are listed in level 1.
Some macros are deleted from the list for brevity.
On level 2, the macros `snip` and `snip:define` are defined at the moment.

* `/userDefinedMacros` `GET` *body:* none, *response body:* the user defined macros for all the nesting levels.
Content type is `application/json`.
A typical response JSON is

[source,json]
----
{
  "scopes": [
    [
      {
        "open": "{",
        "content": " x .. y .. z",
        "close": "}",
        "parameters": [
          "x",
          "y",
          "z"
        ],
        "id": "a",
        "type": "javax0.jamal.engine.UserDefinedMacro"
      },
      {
        "open": "{",
        "content": " {b-X-Y-Z} .. H .. K",
        "close": "}",
        "parameters": [],
        "id": "z",
        "type": "javax0.jamal.engine.UserDefinedMacro"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
----

This example lists two user-defined macros on the first level, the only level in the sample.
The macros are `a` and `z`.
The output defines for each macro

** The macro opening string. (!)
** The macro closing string. (!)
** The content of the macro. (!)
** The parameter names of the macro. (!)
** The class name of the macro.

The (!) parameters are not defined if the type is not `javax0.jamal.engine.UserDefinedMacro`.

* `/execute` `POST` *body:* Jamal macro text to be executed, *response body:* the result of the processing as plain text.
In case there is an error (405) then the response is JSON format containing the error message, stack trace etc.

The stack trace in the sample is abbreviated and also broken into several lines.
This is only for documentation purposes.


* `/all` `GET` *body:* none, *response body:* the responses of the other commands put into a single JSON.
This command can be used to get the result of other `GET` commands together in a single JSON.
The URL parameters are the names of the other commands for which the response is needed.
These are: `level`, `state`, `input`, `output`, `inputBefore`, `processing`, `builtIn`, `userDefined`, `version`.

* `/run` `POST` *body:* breakpoints, *response body:* none
This command can be used to execute the code until the end or until a breakpoint is hit.
The body of the request is interpreted as plain text.
It split up into separate lines.
The execution stops when the current macro or text evaluated in the next step contains any of the break point strings.

* `/step` `POST` *body:* none, *response body:* none.
This command will ask the debugger to step one macro evaluation further.
If this step includes macro evaluation inside the currently evaluated macros, the stepping will not stop there.

* `/stepInto` `POST` *body:* none, *response body:* none.
This command will ask the debugger to step one macro evaluation, further stepping into the nested macro evaluations.

* `/quit` `POST` *body:* none, *response body:* none.
This command will quit the debugger and then terminates the Jamal processor by throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`.
