= Jamal All Dependencies

This module contains no code.
It can be used as a Maven dependency when there is a need to use all Jamal modules.
It can be a convenience supporting some laziness, but in some cases it may be a necessity.

The trigger to create this module was to make it possible to use the different macro libraries in the doclet version of Jamal.
When you want to include Jamal macros in your JavaDoc using Maven, you have to configure your Maven javadoc plugin to use the Jamal Doclet and Taglet.
The doclet module has a limited dependency including only the Jamal core library in addition to the JARs that contain the engine.
Although it seems to be reasonable to configure the other libraries as taglet libraries it does not work.

The solution is to have a JAR project that has all the needed dependencies and add it to your POM as the following:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.javax0.jamal</groupId>
    <artifactId>jamal-all</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

This will add the following dependencies to your project:


* `jamal-engine`

* `jamal-api`

* `jamal-tools`

* `jamal-core`

* `jamal-assertions`

* `jamal-jamal`

* `jamal-markdown`

* `jamal-mock`

* `jamal-plantuml`

* `jamal-snippet`

* `jamal-yaml`

* `jamal-json`

* `jamal-prog`

* `jamal-maven-load`

* `jamal-groovy`

* `jamal-io`

* `jamal-openai`

* `jamal-ruby`

* `jamal-scriptbasic`

* `jamal-word`

* `jamal-java`

* `jamal-maven-plugin`

* `jamal-maven-extension`

* `jamal-cmd`

* `jamal-doclet`

* `jamal-asciidoc`

* `jamal-debug`

* `jamal-maven-input`

* `jamal-jar-input`


[NOTE]
====
Note that this list is maintained automatically using Jamal.
The Jamal Maven extension works with the `pom.jam` file.
This file imports the definition of the module list from `modules.jim`.
Jamal creates the `README.adoc` file, from `README.adoc.jam`.
If you can see the list of the modules above then you read the AsciiDoc version.
If you read the `README.asdoc.jam` then you can see the Jamal macros that include the `modules.jim` file also used by the POM.

This ensures that there is no manual editing of the list of the modules separately for the documentation.
If the list of the modules changes in the project it will automatically change in the documentation as well.
