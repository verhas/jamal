You do not need to remember not to use the parentheses.
* Asciidoctor's extension supports both 2.5.10 and 3.0.0-alpha.1 versions of Asciidoctor.
It is not integration tested for the 3.X.X versions because IntelliJ plugin currently supports 2.X.X versions only.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/2.1.0[2.1.0]

* `java:insert` macro can insert a macro result into a Java source file between

  <editor-fold id="">
  </editor-fold>
+
lines.

* Macro `java:sources` can load the sources and compile as well, as from the compiled classes so that other macros can reference.
Macros `java:classes`, `java:methods`, `java:fields` can be used to list the classes, methods, and the fields of a class.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/2.0.1[2.0.1]

Bug fix release.
A bug driving the `prog` macro into infinite loop was fixed.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/2.0.0[2.0.0]

* The 'extensions' plugin was removed from the Maven extension dependency and from the asciidoc extension.

* Macro `program` can also be used with `do` and `run` aliases.

* File handling can read from a JAR file.

* `maven:load` can load macros from maven repository.

* `jbim` macro package was developed that can compile and load Java code from the Jamal file.

* Jbang, Asciidoctor, and command line versions do not package the scripting modules.
Any script needing those have to use the `maven:load` macro to load the modules.

* Core macro include also uses the `{` and `}` characters to delimit the macro when the included file starts with `{@`.

* when you specify a range, like in the macro `include` option `lines` you can use `inf` or `infinity` to denote the infinity as the start or end of a range (case-insensitive).

* docker is used to support integration level tests, especially the access control check of the configuration needed by the macro `maven:load`.

* The core macro `define` implements the option `tail` to have the last parameter containing the rest of the input instead of getting an error.

* The snippet library implements Base64 encoding and decoding. Using this macro you can insert Kroki pictures into your document. There is also a `res:kroki.jim` importable resource script.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.12.6[1.12.6]
There is a new macro library `prog` that implements a simple BASIC like programming language.

Snippet library macro `directory` has the same formatting options as `file` macro.
There are two new macros in the snippet library: `unicode` and `numbers`.
The `snip:check` macro implements the options `warning` and `error`.
JShell handling improved. When there is no JShell it causes BadSyntax and thus can be handled using the macro `try`.

When closing the processor exceptions are cleared not only when there are closers.
This was a bug causing the exceptions reappearing using the macros `sample` and `output`.

The handling of external files, like `res:`, and `https:` were moved to services found using the service loader mechanism.
Loading files from Maven artifacts was implementing this service.

The prog macro package is implemented giving imperative simple BASIC like programming capabilities.

The Asciidoc preprocessor for the IntelliJ Asciidoctor plugin supports the `prefixLog` option.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.12.5[1.12.5]

* Asciidoctor extension works with any file and converts whatever it can to Asciidoc.

* There is a converter for Markdown, Xml and general text.

* It is possible to write a general converter for any file, which is edited as text and can be converted to asciidoc.
The converter will be picked up by the Asciidoctor plugin's Jamal preprocessor.

* Asciidoctor preprocessor sets the classloader and that way Snakeyaml can load the Ref files and processing works in the editor as well.

* There is a system property `intellij.asciidoctor.plugin` set only in IntelliJ Asciidoctor plugin.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.12.4[1.12.4]

* Asciidoctor extension works on all `*.jam` files.
If the extension is not `.adoc.jam` it formats the display as preformatted Asciidoc text.
* Asciidoctor extension can read directly from the `.jam` file when the `fromFile` option is used.
* Bug fixed that sometimes resulted undefined counters.
* Asciidoctor gracefully handles the front-matter when working with Jekyll files

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.12.3[1.12.3]

* Various bugfixes and dependency version updates.

* Sorting macro is available in the snippet library, developed by Michael

* the macro `define` has options for all the different "define" types, like pure, verbatim etc.
Originally these can be reached using special characters, which are less verbose, but cryptic.
The old syntax is still usable,but not recommended.

* `file` macro in snippet package now has formatting placeholders `bareNaked` and `nakedN` as well as `extensions` and `extensionN` with the possible `N` values being 1,2,3,4, and 5.

* the macro `counter` can save its actual value using `->` .
This is a shortcut to a series of macros.

* The asciidoctor preprocessor caches the result of the last run and executes Jamal only when the  input changes.
It also takes the included and imported files into account.

* a bug in the core of the processing engine that caused in some rare cases over indexing exception

* the environment variable `JAMAL_DEV_PATH` now can point to a file instead of containing the replacements directly

* Macros reading and writing a file can go through a hook that the embedding application can provide.
It is used by the asciidoctor implementation to list all the files read during the processing.

* Jamal mock library is implemented, that can be used to mock some macro for user defined macro testing

* A warning is given when a macro is defined in a scope, but it is not used

* Macro `for` supports the aliases `sep and `subsep`

* In addition to the special characters in the macro `define`, the behaviour can also be altered using options.

* the option `RestrictedDefineParameters` is now available for the `define` macro, to restrict parameter names to be identifiers

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.12.2[1.12.2]

* Doclet is fixed. It can use all modules.

* `snip` macro itself can transform, there is no need for an extra `snip:transform` macro around it

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.12.1[1.12.1]

* When the macro `for` was used with the option `evalist` the list could not include file using a relative file name because the evaluation was done by the processor on an input that had no file reference. This is a bugfix release.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.12.0[1.12.0]

* It is possible to include a Word doc file into another word doc file using the `docx:include` macro.

* You can insert a picture into a Word document using a Jamal macro.
Since picture insertion is a basic function of Microsoft Word this functionality is to be used for special purposes only.

* The macro `snip` can also check if a snippet has changed using the `hash` parameter.
There is no need to invoke a separate `snip:check` macro.

* There is an Asciidoctor extension, which can be used in IntelliJ to edit Jamal extended Asciidoc in a WYSIWYG way.

* The Asciidoctor extension emits a `sed` command at the end of the error report, just in case and to help the lazy.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.11.3[1.11.3]

Technical release, must not be used.
It is not present on GitHub only in Maven central.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.11.2[1.11.2]

* Bug fix release. The `jamal-word` module has now fixed a bug that caused index out of range error in some cases.
The bug manifested if the word document contained a 'run' that contained no text in it.

* Some experimental `docx:` macros are also included in this release to control the generated output docx file to be protected from editing and to force track changes.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.11.1[1.11.1]

* Fully reworked command-line interface

* Jamal macros can be used in Microsoft Word documents

* Io module implements `io:exec` and `io:waitFor` macros to start external processes

* Use of the external library picocli was eliminated

* File input converts `\r\n` to `\n` on Windows.

* Graphviz example was added to the integration tests, runs only on properly configured systems, it needs Graphviz installed eventually.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.11.0[1.11.0]

* Jamal provides suggestion in case a macro name is misspelled.

* Macro parameter handling provides suggestions when the parameter name is misspelled.
  The suggestions are based on the Levenshtein distance.

* Root directory finding and converting all jamal files with exclude/include list is part of the API.
  This API is supposed to be used during unit test execution, which creates the documentation from the Jamal files.
  Finding the project root directory is also part of the API.

* Macro statelessness was NOT checked by default in prior versions due to a bug.
  This bug is fixed and the macro statelessness is now checked by default.
  The macro statelessness check was also implemented when registering global macros.

* Macro `replaceLines` can have multiple `replace` parameters.

* The macro `snip:transform` was developed.

* Macro register export also experts built-in macros.

* New core macro named `macro` was added.

* New API class `JamalOutputStream` was added, which is a filtering output stream.

* Macro `include` has a parameter `lines`, which can limit which lines to include.

* Error reporting was fixed avoiding circular exceptio references when closers were running.
For the user this means cleaner error report.

* New macros `range`, and `untab` in the snippet library. It is also supported by the `snip:transform` macro.

* Macro `snip:collect` can collect snippets which start and stop with the asciidoc tag notation:
`tag::name[]` and `end::name[]`.

* Macro `snip` implements the `poly` option to concatenate snippets.

`thinXml`  macro was added.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.10.3[1.10.3]

Support for ThinXML was added.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.10.2[1.10.2]

The position in error messages became hierarchical showing the position not only where the error is, but also where the actual file was imported, included from.
Snippets can be collected from resource and from teh web using file names that start with `res:` and `https://`.
Snippet collection still fails when trying to collect snippets from binary files, but the error message is more readable.
SnipCheck can be switched off using -Djamal.snippet.check=false
SnipLoad and SnipSave macros were developed letting the macro save and/or load snippets from an XML file
`string:xxx` macros now properly handle their arguments and do not use the whole input as an argument.
It makes difference in case of leading spaces.
Xml formatting is fixed.
Former formatting deleted the new lines from the output, that adversely affected CDATA content.
The new format fixes this and also adds a trailing `\n` at the end of the XML file.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.10.1[1.10.1]

The snippet library was extended with two new macros `xml:define` and `xml:insert`.
When an XML user-defined macro is used without an argument then the whole XML formatted is returned.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.10.0[1.10.0]

New macro `defer`, which evaluates its input after the whole input was processed in a closer.

Due to a bug, the backslash character did not escape the following newline after an `escape` macro (ironic).
Fixed.

The old-style macro evaluation is not available anymore. This significantly sped up the processing.
There were bug fixes for bugs that, in some situations, prevented the proper handling of `~/...` format file names.

Some environment variables did not have the system property pair.
Fixed.

The maven plugin, when used to convert a project to a Jamalized project, does not create `.mvn/extensions.xml` in the subdirectories anymore.

There is a new environment variable `JAMAL_DEV_PATH` and system property `jamal.dev.path`.
See the documentation.

A bug prevented file `include` in Windows in some special cases.
Fixed.

`snipline NAME` can be used to define a single line snippet without an end snippet.

Options `noUndefault` and `emptyUndef` are handled by macro evaluation.

`xmlFormat` works even in applications that embed Jamal in multi-thread.

`snip:check` is reworked, extended, and improved.

The core macro `if` now has several options, and it is possible to test numeric comparisons as well as string emptiness.

JUNIT dependency upped to 5.2.0

The handling of the `lenient` option has changed. From now on, `lenient` has to be a global option.

Environment variable handling was refactored, and the documentation was moved to the class defined in the API module.

JavaScript dependencies were upped to newer versions to avoid security issues.

Counter macros (from snippet) can be invoked with the parameter `last` to simply return the last value.

KillLine macro has to option `keep` that reverses which lines to keep and which lines to keep.

There is a new `snip:lineCount` macro that returns the number of lines in a snippet.

Options are not stored in option stores anymore.
Options are simple `Identified` objects stored along with the user-defined macros.
This also means that options can individually be exported, and the whole options store cannot be exported anymore in one.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.9.1[1.9.1]

The macro `escape` was extended.
Now if the macro name `escape` is followed by a `*` character then the escaping works multiple levels and is unescaped only when the whole processing is finished.
There is a new option for the Maven plugin of Jama.
If you specify the system option `jamalize` to be `true` then the plugin will create all the `.env` directories and `extensions.xml` files.
There was a bug in the macro `plantuml` in release 1.9.0, which prevented its working when no folder was defined explicitly.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.9.0[1.9.0]

Maven extension module is developed.
Using this module there is no need to preprocess `pom.xml.jam` or `pom.jam` files.
Maven automatically reads those files instead of the `pom.xml` using the extension.
Ruby scripts do not share the global variables any more.
It was a bug that the differently named Ruby scripts used the same set of global variables.
Ruby and Groovy macros can be configured using options and not only user defined macros.
`plantuml` macro also uses options and not only user defined macros to define the parameters like the image directory.
Built-in macros can have multiple names, and the assertion package immediately starts to use it so `equals` and `equal` ending denote the same macro.
Evaluate can evaluate macros in its input in a loop till all macros get evaluated.
Environment variable can be queried to throw exception when the variable is not defined.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.8.0[1.8.0]

SnipCheck was introduced to enforce snippet and documentation consistency.
There is a new package to check consistency.
This is the assertions package.
The macro statefulness is checked during macro load an in case a macro is stateful and not annotated to signal this then the macro load fails.
XML snippet reading bug (using CWD instead of document dir) was fixed.
Different dependencies were updated to the latest releases.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.7.9[1.7.9]

`{@undefined }` macros can be `{@define ! ...}` defined

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.7.8[1.7.8]

This release opens the debugger package, and so it can be used from Java::Geci. It still needs investigation why this is needed, though, but this patch solves this issue.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.7.7[1.7.7]

Markdown module was added with one single macro. Using this you can use markdown in JavaDoc files.
Macro can implement its own fetching, and that way now escape macro can also be aliased.
Option nl is removed, does not exist any more. Any \ after a macro escapes the next new line character.
For has new keyword from to iterate through a collection that a user defined ObjectHolder macro can provide.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.7.6[1.7.6]

Yaml XML macro extended to have attributes and CDATA in the output when you design a Yaml, especially for XML.
Macro `define` can specify optional parameters.
It is an error to use `:=` on a parameterless macro without `()` to avoid ambiguity.
Even I, who created the whole shenanigans, could not remember if `a:=` defines a global or a pure macro.

== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.7.5[1.7.5]

yaml can be exported as XML

phantom parameters are handled correctly in case a macro does not have a parameter but there are zero string resulting macros evaluated in the parameters
InputHandler got a new startWith method
ScriptBasic module was reintegrated, following the release and is now part of the release
it is possible to define a user defined macro default which is used in case a macro is not defined. The real good use of it is when the user defined macro is defined using Java support and has special logic.


== https://github.com/verhas/jamal/tree/1.6.3[1.6.3]

A new format for the for loop macro that lets you have values that contain the ) character inside.
