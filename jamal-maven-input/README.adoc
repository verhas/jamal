= Jamal Maven Input Plugin

This library can handle files which are in maven archives.
Using this library any `inluce`, `import` or other macros that need to read a file can access maven archives.
The only requirement is that this library has to be on the class path of the running Jamal implementation.
This is the case by default for most of the configurations.

== Resource Name Format

To access a file from a Maven archive the file name has to be formatted

.Maven resource format
****
`maven` : __groupId__ : __artifactId__ : __version__ : __dependency types__ : file path and name
****

* The `maven:` part is a fix prefix, like in the case of `res:` reading Java resources, or `https:` reading web files.

* The __groupId__ : __artif actId__ : __version__ part should define the Maven coordinates of the artifact.

* The __dependency types__ can be empty, or it can contain one or more of the following words comma separated: `COMPILE`, `PROVIDED`, `RUNTIME`, `TEST`, `SYSTEM`.
When this part is empty, essentially having two `::` in this part, then only the archive specified is used to locate the file.
When there is one or more dependency types specified then the process will download recursively all the dependencies and all of them will be consulted for the given resource.
If there are more than one files in the different artifacts for a given name, then the first found is returned.
There is no guaranteed order in which the artifacts are searched.

****
Example:

[source]
----
{@include [verbatim] maven:com.javax0.jamal:jamal-groovy:1.12.5:compile:version.properties}
----

will result

[source]
----
version=1.12.5
----

The file `version.properties` can be found in the `jamal-api` artifact.
It is a dependency of the `jamal-groovy` artifact.

If you try omitting the `compile` dependency

[source]
----
{@include [verbatim] maven:com.javax0.jamal:jamal-groovy:1.12.5::version.properties}
----

you will get

[source]
----
Cannot read file 'maven:com.javax0.jamal:jamal-groovy:1.12.5::version.properties' from any of the directories: 
----

but

[source]
----
{@include [verbatim] maven:com.javax0.jamal:jamal-api:1.12.5::version.properties}
----

you will get

[source]
----
version=1.12.5
----

will work.

== Configuration

When accessing a file with the `maven:` prefix the implementation will first consult the local Maven repository.
If there is an artifact with the given name, then the file will be read from there.

If the artifact cannot be found locally then the implementation will try to download it from one or more Maven repositories.

The default value for the local repository is  `~/.m2/repository`.
The location of the repository can be configured with the `JAMAL_LOCAL_REPO` environment variable or `jamal.local.repo` system property.

The default value for the remote repositories is the Central Repository of Maven.
The location of the remote repositories can be configured with the `JAMAL_REMOTE_REPOS` environment variable or `jamal.remote.repos` system property.
(Note the 's' at the end of the property name.)
The value of this configuration property is a comma separated list of URLs.

The most well-known repositories have an abbreviation in the system.
They can be used by their name instead of the full URL.
