= Jamal ScriptBasic integration module


Using this integration module you can mix Jamal macro text with ScriptBasic code snippets.
To use this module you have to add the dependency to you Maven project, as:


[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.javax0.jamal</groupId>
    <artifactId>jamal-scriptbasic</artifactId>
    <version>1.10.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

----

This library has one single macro, `basic`.
Using this macro you can embed BASIC programs into your Jamal file, as


[source]
----
{@import res:scriptbasic.jim}
{expr 13+1}{@define start=1}{@define end=13}
{#basic for i={start} to {end}
if i%2 = 1 then
  oddity = "odd"
else
  oddity = "even"
endif
print i,". is an ",oddity," number\n"
next
}

----
resulting

[source]
----
14
1. is an odd number
2. is an even number
3. is an odd number
4. is an even number
5. is an odd number
6. is an even number
7. is an odd number
8. is an even number
9. is an odd number
10. is an even number
11. is an odd number
12. is an even number
13. is an odd number


----

There is also an include file defining a few user defined macros.
You can refer to this include file, as

[source]
----
{@import res:javax0/jamal/scriptbasic/scriptbasic.jim}
----

in your Jamal file. It will let you write things, like

----
{expr 13+14*55}
----

This will evaluate the expression and result the value of the expression.
For more complex code you can use the macro `basic`, which is essentially same as the bui√©t-in macro of the same name.

to execute a whole BASIC program and get the output into the Jamal output.

Note that you can also mix Jamal into the BASIC.
It was demonstrated in the example above.
The macro invocation `{#basic ...}` was using the `#` character, therefore the content is evaluated before it is passed to the built-in macro `basic`.
That way the macros `{start}` and `{end}` are evaluated first.
The BASIC interpreter already gets `for i=1 to 13`.
