{%llama The following text contains some PII.
PII stands for Personally Identifiable Information.
It refers to any data that could potentially identify a specific individual.
This includes a variety of information such as:

Full name
Social Security number
Email address
Phone number
Physical address
Passport number
Driver's license number
Bank account information
Credit card information
IP addresses in some contexts
Login credentials
Dates (birthdays, anniversaries, etc.)

The importance of protecting PII is emphasized in various data protection regulations,
such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States.
Organizations are required to implement measures to safeguard PII to
prevent unauthorized access, identity theft, and other privacy violations.

I want you to identify each and every PII in the following text and replace each character that
belongs to some PII to X and leave the other characters intact. If you think that a character belongs to a PII
then make sure that all the characters of that word are masked. If you see something that is part of a data, ensure that all the words that belong to that date are masked.

Do not write any explanation or any other text before or after the text, provide only the masked text.
