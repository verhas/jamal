Should I cmpr u 2 a smmr?s day?

U r more lvly & more mdrt.

Strng winds shke the dlcte buds of May,

& smmr doesn?t lst lng enuf.

Smtms the sun shns 2 ht,

& oftn its gld face is dmmd;

& evryting btful loses its bty vntually,

By chnce, or by ntr?s nvtble chnges;

But ur etrnl bty will nvr fade,

Nor lose psssn of the bty u have,

Nor will dth clm u 4 its own,

Bcz u will lv on in these etrnl lns.

As lng as ppl brthe or have eyes 2 see,

So lng will this pm lv,

& it will give life 2 u.
