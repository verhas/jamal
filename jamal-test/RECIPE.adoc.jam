NOTE: This document demonstrates how you can use the floating point calculations introduced in Jamal `{%RELEASE:PECS%}` to the prog module to maintain documents that need that.
The sample document is a recipe of my favourite food, spaghetti carbonara.
The recipe is written for 4 people, but it also includes adjustments for 2, 6, and 8 people.
It also demonstrates how you can specify the ingredient amounts in different units and then convert them to the desired unit based on the number of people.
Also note that he amounts are defined only once in the file and then reused in the recipe and the adjustments sections.
