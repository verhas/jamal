= Jamal Maven Load Module

The Jamal Maven Load module contains a macro to download Java JAR files from Maven repositories during run-time and load the macro classes into the running application.

I designed the library's security, balancing the ease of use and the application's security.
Without security measures, a Jamal file could execute any Java code published online, which is not a good idea.
The Jamal installation has to be adequately configured to use this module.
The requirements of a proper configuration are described in the section about security.

== Macro

Currently, there is only one macro defined in this module.

=== `maven:load`

It loads the macros from a Maven artifact and its dependencies unless the `noDependencies` option is used.

This macro reads its input and interprets it as a maven coordinate set.
The format has to be

          groupId:artifactId:version

You have to specify all three coordinates.
The macro works in two steps:

1. First, it downloads the artifact JAR and all the dependencies.

2. Using a class loader, it loads the macros from the JAR files (the specified one and the dependencies).

Loading only the file without the dependencies is possible using the `noDependencies` option.

[WARNING]
====
Loading a JAR file from the internet is a security risk.
You must configure the security appropriately to mitigate this risk.
For more information, see the section about security.
====

The behavior of the macro can be controlled using options.
The options should follow the macro's name between `(` and `)` characters.
The options are:

* `repositories` (aliases are `repository`, `repo`, `repos`) define the Maven repositories used comma separated.
The values are the repository URLs or symbolic names.
The symbolic names can be
- `central`
- `jcenter-bintray`
- `google-android`
- `google-maven-central-americas`
- `google-maven-central-europe`
- `google-maven-central-asia`
+
The default value is `central`.
When a URL is specified, it is checked against the configuration.
The symbolic names are permitted by default; they can be used without configuration.
URLs must be configured in the `maven.load.repo` configuration property.
For more information, see the section about security.

* `noDependencies` (alias is `noDeps`) says that the dependencies of the JAR should not be loaded.
The default value is `false`.

* `reload` (aliases are `overwrite`, `update`) says that macros found in the JAR should be reloaded even if they were
already loaded.

* `local` can specify the location of the local Maven repository.
The default value is `~/.m2/repository`.
If this option is used, it is checked against the configuration.
For more information, see the section about security.

* `exclude` can specify a comma-separated list of maven coordinates that should not be loaded.
This parameter will not stop loading the "root" artifact specified in the macro input.
The coordinates format is the same as in the configuration file for the `maven.load.exclude` property regarding the wildcards.

If the configuration or the security prevents the load, the macro throws an `IllegalStateException`.
It means that the processing will stop.
Also, it is impossible to catch and handle this error using the `{@try ...}` macro.

== Security and Safe Configuration

The macro `maven:load` reads the configuration of Jamal via an API that works only when the configuration is secure.

=== Secure configuration

This macro works only if your configuration files' access control is set correctly.
Without that, someone accessing the computer in a different account could modify the configuration, potentially loading malicious code.

The configuration must be secure, meaning:

* There is no configuration.
In that case, nothing can be opened, so there is no security risk.
However, in this case, the macro cannot load any JAR file.
OR

The configuration directory and the files are _SAFE_
====
* `~/.jamal`, and the files
* `~/.jamal/settings.properties`, and
* `~/.jamal/settings.xml` are _SAFE_
====


A file or directory is _SAFE_ if
====
* it does not exist, or

* owned by the current user and

* not writable by anyone else, and

* not readable by anyone else,

* not listable (`x` flag) by anyone else.

* In the case of a plain file, it is not executable (`x` flag) by anyone, including the current user.

* It is a plain file when it is supposed to be a file, and it is a directory when it is supposed to be a directory.
====

When reading the configuration, if any of the

====
* `maven.load.include`

* `maven.load.exclude`

* `maven.load.local`

* `maven.load.repo`

properties point to files; these files should also be _SAFE_.
====

NOTE: Securing the configuration is not a must for Jamal's other parts and functionalities, although it is a good practice.
The security is only checked before reading the configuration for the `maven:load` macro.

Also, the `maven:load` macro uses a unique API to read the configuration.
Every time the macro runs, the API rereads the files, checks the security of the configuration, and ignores the in-memory cached configuration.
Also, note that while most of the macros and functionalities of Jamal read configuration via an API that consults the system properties first, environment variables second, and lastly, only
the configuration files,

====
the API used by the `maven:load` macro reads only the configuration files in the directory `~/.jamal/`.
These are `~/.jamal/settings.properties` or `~/.jamal/settings.xml`.
====

[NOTE]
====
When Jamal is executed in an interactive environment the security for a specific `maven:load` macro is checked only once.
The security is checked only when the macro tries to load the classes.
When the classes were loaded by the same JVM in a previous run, the security is not checked again.

It also means that changing the configuration to prevent the load of a macro library that was already loaded is futile.
On the other hand, changing the configuration to allow the load of a macro library that failed to load due to security settings is effective.
There is no need to restart the application executing Jamal.
====

=== Configuration

The `maven:load` macro has to be configured for security reasons.
It can only load JAR files which are explicitly allowed by the configuration.
Also, the remote and local repositories must be configured unless the well-known hardwired repositories are used with the default local location.

The values for the property keys are

* comma-separated list of maven coordinates + path,

* absolute paths,

* URLs, or

* a file name that contains the list of the same information.

When a key points to a file, the file also has to be _SAFE_ as defined in the previous section.
It has to be in the same directory as the configuration file and has to be specified by the bare name and extension but without any path.
The file contains the configuration information, one per line.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the comma-separated list in the `.properties` file.
However, it is better to use a file when you have many configuration items.
The file contains the list of configuration items, one per line.
====

==== `maven.load.include`

The configuration should always have the property `maven.load.include` set.
The property gives the list of permitted maven coordinates.

Every maven coordinate has to be in the format

          groupId:artifactId:version

or

          groupId:artifactId:version:path

The `groupId` cannot be a wildcard.
The `artifactId` and `version` may be a wildcard `*`.
The path part is optional.
If the `artifactId` is a wildcard, then the `version` has to be a wildcard too.

The path represents the path to the Jamal source.
It can be the absolute path to the Jamal input file or the directory containing one or more Jamal input files.
If the path is a directory, `maven:load` is also permitted for all subdirectories.
When the value ends with a `/`, it is considered a directory.

When the path is specified, it is compared against the path of the Jamal source.
The Jamal source file has to be the same or has to be in the specified directory.

The macro `maven:load` is sometimes used from a file included or imported by the top Jamal source directly or through other includes or imports.
In this case, the path of the top-level Jamal file is used only.

==== `maven.load.exclude`

The key `maven.load.exclude` can exclude some maven coordinates from the list of allowed coordinates.
If a coordinate is excluded, it cannot be used even if included in the `maven.load.include` list.

A coordinate will also be skipped if one is present as a dependency.
In this case, however, the download will not stop.
The class loading, however, may still fail if classes are missing because of the exclusion.

==== `maven.load.local`

The key `maven.load.local` can be used to specify the location of the local Maven repository.
It has to be configured when the option `local` is used.
The values have to specify the absolute paths of the allowed directories that can be used as local repositories.

WARNING: This is a security configuration.
Specifying a location here will not change the default location.
It merely lists the allowed locations.

==== `maven.load.repo`

The key `maven.load.repo` can be used to specify the list of allowed remote repositories in addition to the predefined ones.
The values must be the URLs appearing in the `repositories` option of the `maven:load` macro.

WARNING: This is a security configuration.
Specifying a URL here will not change the default repository.
It merely lists the allowed repositories.
