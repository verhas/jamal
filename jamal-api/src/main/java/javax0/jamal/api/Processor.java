     * Register an AutoCloseable closer that has to be closed when the execution is finished.
     * <p>
     * Some user defined (Java implemented) or built-in macro may create resources that perform some actions
     * asynchronous. The typical example is when a macro that creates some external resource starts a separate thread to
     * execute the task. This task has to be joined at the end of the processing. The general model is that there is a
     * resource that has to be closed. The {@code closer} may be the resource itself or some object that will close the
     * resource.
     * <p>
     * Closing as an operation may be treated fairly liberal. Almost anything can be "closing". The macro
     * {@code xmlFormat}, for example, "closes" the operation replacing the final output of Jamal with the XML-formatted
     * version.
     * <p>
     * The {@code closer} may also implement the interfaces {@link javax0.jamal.api.Closer.ProcessorAware} or {@link
     * javax0.jamal.api.Closer.OutputAware} or both.
     * In that case, the
     * {@link javax0.jamal.api.Closer.ProcessorAware#set(Processor) set(Processor)}
     * and/or
     * {@link javax0.jamal.api.Closer.OutputAware#set(Input)  set(Input)}
     * methods will be called before calling {@link AutoCloseable#close() close()} passing the {@link Processor}
     * or the {@link Input} instance holding the final processed output as argument.
     * <p>
     * Since the call to {@link AutoCloseable#close() close()} comes before {@link Processor#process(Input)} returns the
     * output may be altered by the implemented {@link AutoCloseable#close() close()} method. That way a built-in macro
     * may implement post-processing logic that works on the whole output.
     * <p>
     * The sample test {@code javax0.jamal.engine.TestProcessor#testPostProcessor()} in the file {@code
     * src/test/java/javax0/jamal/engine/TestProcessor.java} shows an example that converts the whole result to
     * uppercase.
     * <p>
     * The closer objects {@link AutoCloseable#close() close()} method may invoke the injected processors
     * {@link Processor#process(Input) process(Input)} method. In this case, however, the processor is already in a
     * state closing resources and processing the whole input again will not recursively invoke the closers. After
     * the input is processed, the invocation of the closers registered in the first round continues. Any closer
     * registered during the call to {@link Processor#process(Input) process(Input)} from a closer will be ignored.
     * <p>
     * Calling this method the macro can register an {@link AutoCloseable} object. The method {@link
     * AutoCloseable#close() close()} will be invoked when the method {@link Processor#process(Input)} finishes its top
     * level execution. When the method is called in recursive calls from a macro or from any other place the deferred
     * resources will not be closed upon return, only when the top level call is to be returned.
     * <p>
     * The processor implementation guarantees that the processor will invoke the closers in the order registered.
     * The processor will never register an already registered closer. In other words, every closer is invoked only
     * once. In the order of executions, the first registering is relevant. A closer {@code c2} is treated as already
     * registered if there is a registered closer {@code c1} so that {@code c1.equals(c2)}.
     * <p>
     * It also means that any call to this method must use the return value of the method to reference the closer and
     * not the object passed as argument, unless they are the same object. If you pass an object {@code c2} that is
     * {@code c1.equals(c2)} but are not the exact same, then the method will return {@code c1} and the object {@code
     * c2} will not be registered.
     * <p>
     * This approach was created to allow the macros to create cheap closer objects and call them from the macro
     * evaluation. In this case, the macro can register the closer when it knows that a closer is needed, and it does
     * not need to maintain a state and remember if there was already a closer registered. Also, the closer is not
     * directly associated with the macro making it possible to register multiple closers assuming they are not
     * equal to each other.
     * <p>
     * Note that this method, or any other method of the processor MUST NOT be invoked from other than the main thread
     * of the Jamal processing. Even if a macro spawns a new thread the new thread must not do anything with the
     * processor.
     *
     * @param closer the autocloseable object to be closed at the end of the processing.
     * @return the registered closer. It may not be the same closer as the argument {@code closer}. If the closer
     * was already registered, then the first registered closer will be returned. More formally, if there was a {@code
     * closer2} already registered such that {@code closer2.equals(closer)} then {@code closer2} will be returned.
