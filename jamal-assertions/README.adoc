= Jamal Assertions


The Jamal assertions module contains macros to check the consistency of the documentation.
The checks are implemented as assertions, asserting some simple conditions and giving an error if the condition is false.
Although it may be used other than checking the consistency of the documentation, that is the module's primary purpose.

Macros can gather information from different parts of the document and the documented system.
The assertions can check that the gathered information is consistent.



== i.Example

For example, the macro

[source]
----
{@snip:xml pom=pom.xml}
----


reads the `pom.xml` file from the same directory where the document is.
It stores the XML in the memory, and you can query it via the `pom` macro afterward.
You can use this `pom` macro with an XPath expression to get parts of the project description.
For example, the following macro will get the version string of the project:

[source]
----
{pom //project/version}
----

This version currently is

[source]
----
1.10.2-SNAPSHOT
----


If we create an assertion that this version is in the `1.xxx` range, we can write it as the following:

[source]
----
here we have an assertion
{#assert:startsWith /{pom //project/version}/1./ERROR: we are not in the 1.xxx range any more}
assertion was okay
----

which results

[source]
----
here we have an assertion

assertion was okay
----


The output of the assertion is an empty string when the condition is ok.
Since the string `{pom //project/version}` starts with `1.`, the assertion does not fail.
If we do a different assertion that tests that the version does NOT start with `1.`, the assertion will result in an error.

[source]
----
{@try! {#assert:startsWith (not) /{pom //project/version}/1./ERROR: we are still in the 1.xxx range}}
if the assertion was not okay, the macro try! displays the error message
----

which results

[source]
----
ERROR: we are still in the 1.xxx range
if the assertion was not okay, the macro try! displays the error message
----


[NOTE]
----
This document uses the `try` macro with the `!` mark after it.
This macro with the `!` evaluates its content and then results in the error message if there was an error.
If you are not familiar with the use of this macro, please consult the link:../README.adoc[Jamal main documentation].
----

Checking documentation consistency can be done in many different ways.
The one we have shown in this section is only a single example.
The assertion package helps consistency checks.

== ii.Use

The macro package is defined in a jar file as a Java module.
The macros are automatically loaded using the service loader.
To use the macros, the library has to be on the classpath.
To do it as a Maven dependency use the following Maven coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.javax0.jamal</groupId>
    <artifactId>jamal-assertions</artifactId>
    <version>1.10.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

== iii.Assertions Formats and Options

All assertions have the same options and the same syntax.
If any, the options follow the macro's name between `(` and `)` characters.
The rest of the macro is the parameters.
The parameters are parsed using the link:../PARAMS.adoc[Standard Built-In Parameter Parsing].
The different assertions can have different number of parameters.
The last parameter is always optional.
If it is present, it specifies the error message for the case the assertion fails.

For example, let us look at the sample we have already visited in the previous section.

[source]
----
{#assert:startsWith (not) /{pom //project/version}/1./ERROR: we are still in the 1.xxx range}
----

The assertion macro `assert:startsWith` has two mandatory parameters and the optional message as the third parameter.
This assertion checks that the first parameter interpreted as a string starts with the second parameter.
In this example, we want an error when the version does NOT start with `1.` thus the use of the option `not`.

All the assertions interpret three options.
These are

* `trim` with the alias `strip`, and
* `not` with the alias `negate`.
* `test` with aliases `boolean` and `bool`.

The option names and the aliases are equivalent; you can use the one that fits your taste.
The first option `trim` tells the assertion that the parameters should be stripped before evaluating the assertion.
This process will remove all white space from the start and the end of the parameters.

The second option, `negate` reverses the outcome of the assertion.

The option `test` will modify the behavior of the macro.
When this option is used the assertion will not fail if the assertion is false.
Instead the return value of the assertion will be the literal string `true` or `false`.


== iv.Macros Implemented in the Package




=== iv.a.  `assert:contains`
Asserts that the first argument contains the second argument.

Example
[source]
----
1. OK: {@assert:contains /abba/bb/contains}
2. OK: {@assert:contains (not) /abba/aa/abba does not contain aa}
3. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:contains /abba/aa/abba does not contain aa}}
4. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:contains /abba/aa/}}
5. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:contains (not) /abba/bb/abba contains bb}}
6. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:contains (not) /abba/bb/}}
----

results

[source]
----
1. OK:
2. OK:
3. ERROR: abba does not contain aa
4. ERROR: assert:contains has failed 'abba' does not contain 'aa'
5. ERROR: abba contains bb
6. ERROR: assert:contains has failed 'abba' contains 'bb'
----


=== iv.b.  `assert:empty`

Asserts that the first argument is a zero-length string.
Note that there is no `assert:blank` assertion.
If you want to check that the argument is empty OR blank, you should use the `trim` option.

Example
[source]
----
1. OK: {@assert:empty //this is empty}
2. OK: {@assert:empty (trim) /    /this is empty also, as trimmed}
3. OK: {@assert:empty (not) /    /this is not empty as expected}
4. OK: {@assert:empty (not trim) /  wuff   /this is not empty as expected, even though trimmed}
5. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:empty (not) //sadly nothing here}}
6. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:empty /    /blank is not empty unless trimmed}}
7. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:empty /wuff/not empty is not empty}}
----

results

[source]
----
1. OK:
2. OK:
3. OK:
4. OK:
5. ERROR: sadly nothing here
6. ERROR: blank is not empty unless trimmed
7. ERROR: not empty is not empty
----


=== iv.c.  `assert:startsWith`

Asserts that the first argument starts with the second argument.

Example
[source]
----
1. OK: {@assert:startsWith /abba/abb/abba starts with abb}
2. OK: {@assert:startsWith (trim) / abba/  abb /the same as above}
3. OK: {@assert:startsWith (not) /abba/ebb/abba does not start with ebb}
4. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:startsWith (not) /abba/abb/ but it does start with abb}}
5. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:startsWith /abba/ebb/abba does not start with ebb}}
----

results

[source]
----
1. OK:
2. OK:
3. OK:
4. ERROR:  but it does start with abb
5. ERROR: abba does not start with ebb
----


=== iv.d.  `assert:endWith`

Asserts that the first argument ends with the second argument.

Example
[source]
----
1. OK: {@assert:endsWith /abba/bba/abba ends with bba}
2. OK: {@assert:endsWith (trim) / abba/  bba /the same as above}
3. OK: {@assert:endsWith (not) /abba/bbe/abba does not end with bbe}
4. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:endsWith (not) /abba/bba/ but it does end with bba}}
5. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:endsWith /abba/bbe/abba does not end with bbe}}
----

results

[source]
----
1. OK:
2. OK:
3. OK:
4. ERROR:  but it does end with bba
5. ERROR: abba does not end with bbe
----


=== iv.e.  `assert:equals`

Asserts that the first and the second arguments are equal strings.

Example
[source]
----
1. OK: {@assert:equals /abba/abba/abba is abba}
2. OK: {@assert:equals (trim) / abba/  abba /the same as above}
3. OK: {@assert:equals (not) /abba/boney m/abba is not boney m}
4. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:equals (not) /abba/abba/abba forever}}
5. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:equals /abba/boney N/we meant real Swedish music}}
6. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:equals /333/+333/this is not numeric comparison}}
----

results

[source]
----
1. OK:
2. OK:
3. OK:
4. ERROR: abba forever
5. ERROR: we meant real Swedish music
6. ERROR: this is not numeric comparison
----


=== iv.f.  `assert:fail`

This assertion has only one optional argument, the message.
If this macro is evaluated, it will always result in an error.
The use of this assertion makes sense in part of the code that is conditionally evaluated, like a part of an `if` macro.
Note that this macro also interprets the `trim` option, though it has no parameters to be trimmed.
The option `trim` can be used but has no effect.
The option `not` is also interpreted.
If the option `not` is used, the macro will result in an empty string and will not error.

Example
[source]
----
1. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:fail just fail, okay? just fail}}
----

results

[source]
----
1. ERROR: just fail, okay? just fail
----




=== iv.g.  `assert:greater`
This assertion interprets the first two arguments as integer values.
It checks that the first argument is greater than the second.

Example
[source]
----
1. OK: {@assert:greater /6/3/six is greater than three}
2. OK: {@assert:greater /-3/-6/minus three is greater than minus six}
3. OK: {@assert:greater (trim) / 6 /  3 /space needs trimming, converted to numeric}
4. OK: {@assert:greater (not) /3/6/three is not greater than six}
5. OK: {@assert:greater (not) /3/3/three is not greater than three}
6. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:greater /60/3A/3A is not numeric}}
7. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:greater / 6 / 3 /with spaces it is not numeric}}
8. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:greater (not) /6/666/six is not greater than 666}}
9. ERROR: {@try! {@assert:greater /3/3/three is not greater than three, three is three}}
