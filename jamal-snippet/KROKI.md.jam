# Using Kroki service

This is a simple demonstration of how you can include pictures using the Kroki service into a Markdown file.

You can import the resource `kroki.jim` into your Markdown file.

{%@import src/main/resources/kroki.jim%}


The `kroki.jim` file contains macros that to include pictures in a Markdown file.


After that, you can use the `kroki` macro to include pictures.

{%kroki /KROKI_MD/plantuml/svg/
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: Another authentication Response
%}

{%kroki /STR/structurizr/svg/
workspace {
model {
user = person "Usar"
softwareSystem = softwareSystem "Software System" {
webapp = container "Web Application" {
user -> this "Uses!!!"
}
database = container "Database" {
webapp -> this "Reads from and writes to"
}
}
}
views {
systemContext softwareSystem {
include *
autolayout lr
}
container softwareSystem {
include *
autolayout lr
}
theme default
}
}
%}

Using Jamal, you can even use macros inside the picture descriptions.
They will be processed before the picture is rendered.
