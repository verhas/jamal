You can use this macro to define a snippet.
Snippets are usually collected from project files, but it is also possible to define them via the macro `snip:define`.
For example,

{%sample/
{@snip:define mySnippet=
It is the snippet, which is defined inside the file and not collected from an external file.
}
{@snip mySnippet}
%}

will result

{%output%}

Snippets typically contain several lines, and the leading spaces may be important.
To accommodate this when you define a snippet using this macro, spaces following the `=` sign up to, and including the new line will be skipped.
As you can see in the example above, there is no new line before the sentence `It is the...`.
It is recommended to have a new line after the `=` character and start the snippet content on the next line.
If you start the snippet right after the `=` character then the spaces between the `=` and the first non-space character will be skipped.
For example:

{%sample/
{@snip:define mySnippet1=     It is the snippet,
which is defined inside the file and not collected from an external file.
}
{@snip mySnippet1}
%}

will result

{%output%}

As you can see there are no spaces before the characters `It is the...`.

A snippet always holds the reference to the file and line number where it was defined.
You may want to have a different location from where the `snip:define` macro is called.
For example, you create a new snippet from an already existing one replacing some parts of it.
It is logical to inherit the location of the snippet to the transformed one.

To do that, you can either specify the file name and the line number using parops, or you can name an already existing snippet to inherit the location from.
The file name and the line number are used

* to report error if there is any, and
* to calculate the file name in the case the snippet gets evaluated and contains an `include` or `import` macro.

{%sample/
{@snip:define (file="./snippy.txt" line=6379) mySnippetA=abra kadabra badir kebi}
{@snip:define mySnippetB=badir kebi, alias Don Sakan}
{@snip:file mySnippetA}
{@snip:file mySnippetB}
%}


will result in
