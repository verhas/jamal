     * <p>
     * The snippet store takes into account the fact that ill-formed snippets can be found in some source files. The
     * identification of the snippet start and snippet end is very liberal in order to let different source files to
     * have a snippet start and end lines with different type of comment lines. Java has one liner comments, XML has
     * other tye of comments. The collection process thinks that a snippet starts if there is a line that contains the
     * word {@code snippet} literally and there is an identifier after it. The end of the snippet is recognized by any
     * line that contains the words {@code end} and {@code snippet} with one or more spaces between them.
     * <p>
     * Because of this liberal approach it may happen, as it happens even in this very JavaDoc comment that the
     * collection process finds a snippet start, but does not find the end of a snippet. This should not be a problem.
     * Jamal snippet handler should handle this case, and it does it.
     * <p>
     * When a snippet is found but there is some error during the collection (a.k.a. there was no 'end snippet' till the
     * end of the file) then the collection process also stores the snippet along with an exception. Using such snippet
     * will throw an exception using the exception from the collection as a cause.
     * <p>
     * If there was a collected snippet, but it had an error, and the snippet we want to define now does not have an
     * exception attached to it, then just replace the old erroneous.
     * <p>
     * If there was a collected snippet, but it had an error, and the snippet we want to define now is also erroneous,
     * then we replace the old one with the new adding the exception of the old one to the current one as suppressed
     * exception.
     * <p>
     * If there was a correct snippet with the given id already defined and the actual snippet is also okay, then a
     * snippet is double defined. In this case the method throws an exception.
