= Jamal Self-Integration module

The integration modules, like plantUML, Ruby, and Groovy, integrate some external processors into Jamal.
These external processors get a text input and provide a text output.
In the case of the Ruby module, the input is the Ruby code.
In the case of the Groovy module, the input is the Groovy code.
The output in both these cases is the program's output embedded into the macro.

Jamal is a processor with a text input and produces text output.
That way, it can be integrated into itself.
The question is if it should be or not.

Using this module, you can have a whole Jamal text inside a macro, probably using different macro start and strop strings.
A separate processor will execute the macros, which will not affect the current execution.

This feature is used in the readme documentation of Jamal.
Till the release of 1.7.2, it was provided using a proprietary, test scope built-in macro.
With this module, this feature, although this is a niche feature, is available to any application.

To use this module, you have to add the dependency to your Maven project as:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.javax0.jamal</groupId>
    <artifactId>jamal-jamal</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

== Macros implemented in the package

Only one built-in macro is defined in the module: `output`.
It uses a separate Jamal processor to evaluate its input and returns the processed result.

On its first use, the macro instantiates a new Jamal processor (internally called `localProc`).
The macro start and end strings are the `{` and `}` characters.

If for any reason, you want to execute the samples in isolated processors, then you can define the option `isolatedOutput`.

[source]
----
{@options isolatedOutput}
----

In that case, the macro will allocate a new Jamal processor (internally called isolatedProc) for every invocation.

You can also use the `isolate` options between `(` and `)` characters in the macro.
If you switch off this option

[source]
----
{@options ~isolatedOutput}
----

the subsequent calls to the macro will use the separate but shared `localProc` Jamal processor.

To use the module in an Asciidoc file, you can include the resource file `jamal.jim` as

[source]
----
{@import res:jamal.jim}
----

after that, you can use the two user-defined macros: `sample` and `output`.
The macro `sample` input is the Jamal text to be evaluated.
The result of the `sample` is the text itself displayed as the source.
When `output` is used, the Jamal text is evaluated, and the result is the output as source code.

The macro opening and closing strings are `{` and `}`.
The sample codes, one after the other, are evaluated in the same processor.
It means that macros, options, or similar constructs are usable in the consequent outputs.

NOTE: The samples are only evaluated when the macro `{%output%}` is invoked.
