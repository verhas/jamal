= Jamal Self integration module

The integration modules, like plantUML, Ruby, Groovy all integrate some external processor into Jamal.
These external processors get a text input and provide a text output.
In case of the Ruby module the input is the Ruby code.
In case of the Groovy module the input is the Groovy code.
The output in both these cases is the output of the program embedded into the macro.

Jamal itself is a processor that has a text input and produces text output.
That way it can be integrated into itself.
The question is if it should be or not?

Using this module you can have a whole Jamal text inside a macro, probably using totally different macro start and strop strings.
The evaluation of the macro will be executed in a separate processor instance and that way it will not have effect on the current execution.

This feature is used in the readme documentations of Jamal.
Till the release 1.7.2 it was provided using a proprietary, test scope built-in macro.
With this module this feature, although this is a niche feature, is available to any application.

To use this module you have to add the dependency to you Maven project, as:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.javax0.jamal</groupId>
    <artifactId>jamal-jamal</artifactId>
    <version>1.10.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

== Macros implemented in the package

There is only one built-in macro defined in the module: `output`.
It uses a separate Jamal processor to evaluate its input and returns the processed result.

The macro instantiates a new Jamal processor (internally called localProc)on its first use.
The macro start and end strings are the `{` and `}` characters.

If for any reason you want to execute the samples in isolated processors then you can define the option `isolatedOutput`.

[source]
----
{@options isolatedOutput}
----

In that case the macro will allocate a new Jamal processor (internally called isolatedProc) for every invocation.

You can also use the `isolate` options between `(` and `)` characters in the macro.
If you switch off this option

[source]
----
{@options ~isolatedOutput}
----

the subsequent calls to the macro will use the separate, but shared, localProc Jamal processor.

To use the module in an ASCIIDOC file you can include the resource file `jamal.jim` as

[source]
----
{@import res:jamal.jim}
----

after that you can use the two user defined macros: `sample` and `output`.
The input of the macro `sample` is the Jamal text to be evaluated.
The result of the `sample` is the text itself displayed as source.
When `output` is used the Jamal text is evaluated, and the result is the output as source code.

The macro opening and closing string is `{` and `}`.
The sample codes one after the other are evaluated in the same processor.
It means that macros, options or other similar constructs are usable in the consequent outputs.

NOTE: The samples are only evaluated when the macro `{%output%}` is invoked.
